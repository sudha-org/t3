            <h2>27<sup>th</sup> August 2013</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A quarter (25 per cent) of parents pack books to keep their child quietly entertained</li>
                <li>Almost a fifth (19 per cent) equips their child with a camera to capture holiday snaps</li>
                <li>Nearly one in five (18 per cent) keeps their child amused with a mobile phone</li>
                <li>A seventh (13 per cent) bring their child&rsquo;s video game(s)</li>
                <li>One in eight (12 per cent) packs an iPad to keep their child occupied</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Modern parents are still relying on traditional activities to keep their children entertained on holidays and the associated long journeys, a new study has found.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research<sup>1</sup> from Direct Line travel insurance found that although gadgets and gizmos are still popular ways of keeping kids content, the old ones really are the best ones. With their educational yet entertaining appeal, books topped the poll, with one in four (25 per cent) parents raiding the bookshelves when packing for their little bookworms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearly one in five (18 per cent) parents are keen to nurture their child&rsquo;s creative side when on holiday by bringing colouring pens and paper, with more women than men choosing this option (23 per cent vs 14 per cent). Other traditional and educational items favoured include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Puzzles / puzzle books (one in six – 17 per cent)</li>
                <li>Familiar bed toys (one in six – 15 per cent)</li>
                <li>Comics / magazines (one in seven – 14 per cent)</li>
                <li>Board games (one in ten – 11 per cent)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The most popular gadget to keep kids busy was a digital camera, with almost one in five (19 per cent) parents channelling their child&rsquo;s inner David Bailey by giving them the opportunity to capture the memories on film for years to come. Other technological items include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile phone (one in five &ndash; 18 per cent)</li>
                <li>Personal music player (one in seven &ndash; 14 per cent)</li>
                <li>Video games (one in seven &ndash; 13 per cent)</li>
                <li>Personal DVD player (one in eight &ndash; 12 per cent)</li>
                <li>iPad (one in eight &ndash; 12 per cent)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of the technological items was favoured more by fathers than mothers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other parents fond of more active forms of entertainment packed ball games (one in ten – nine per cent), a rubber ring or lilo (one in twenty – six per cent) and some even took a boogie board and a dinghy away for a swell time in the sea.
            </p>

                <strong>Tom Bishop, head of travel insurance at Direct Line said</strong>: <em>&ldquo;Holidays are a time to relax and get away from it all, but they inevitably involve long journeys and extended mealtimes which can leave little ones restless. So when you&rsquo;re travelling with children, it&rsquo;s important to plan ahead and pack the right things to keep them entertained and keep parents&rsquo; relaxation levels up.&rdquo;</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bishop continues:</strong> <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no surprise that the research found compact and easily transportable items so popular and gadgets proved to be particularly in demand. If parents plan to take expensive gadgets away, they should check whether the single item limit on their travel insurance policy is enough to cover their replacement and if not, they should speak to their insurer to see if they can raise the limit for an additional fee. It&rsquo;s also worth checking whether the relevant gadget is covered on their home insurance policy away from the home.&rdquo;</em>

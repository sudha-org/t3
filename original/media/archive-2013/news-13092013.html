An incredible one in five dog owners admit that their phone gallery is 75 per cent full with pet pictures as 90 per cent of dog owners reveal they take more pictures of their pet than their partners.

                Edd Barclay, head of Direct Line Pet Insurance, comments: &ldquo;When it comes to your phone or social media profile, pets win over partners. The majority (86 per cent) admitted they would prefer their pet as their screensaver and 45 per cent always use a picture of their pet as their social media profile.
            </p>

                &ldquo;Dog owners are passionate about their hounds, as they are very much part of the family and owners are more than happy to share and show off their canine friends.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                The research commissioned by Direct Line and K9 Media revealed that out of the respondents that do not take daily pictures of their pet, 72 per cent take weekly pictures. Dog owners mostly do this to capture special moments (45 per cent) and to capture something funny to share with friends and family (29 per cent). Keen to catch them in the act, 15 per cent of pet owners try to capture their dog doing something naughty.

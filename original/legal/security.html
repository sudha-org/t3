			<h3><strong><a id="term02"></a>How we will use your information and who we will share it with</strong></h3>
			<p>Direct Line insurance policies are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited (UKI). When you give us your information, it will be used and shared within the UKI owned brands. We will do that in order to provide you with the best possible products and service experience.</p>

			<h3><strong><a id="term03"></a>Where we transfer your information</strong></h3>
			<p>From time to time we may require services from suppliers that are based worldwide and your information will be shared with them for the purposes of providing that service. Where we engage these suppliers we make sure that they apply the same levels of protection, security and confidentiality we apply. However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term04"></a>Sensitive Information</strong></h3>
			<p>Some of the personal information we ask you for may be sensitive personal information, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 (such as information about health or criminal convictions).

			<h3><strong><a id="term05"></a>Dealing with other people</strong></h3>

If you would like someone else to deal with your policy on your behalf on a regular basis please let us know. In some exceptional cases we may also deal with other people who call on your behalf, with your consent. If at any time you would prefer us to deal only with you, please let us know.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term06"></a>Keeping you informed</strong></h3>

			<h3><strong><a id="term07"></a>Fraud Prevention and Anti-Money Laundering</strong></h3>
			<p>Please take time to read the following as it contains important information relating to the details you have given or should give to us. You should show this notice to anyone whose data has been supplied to us in connection with your policy.</p>
			<p>To prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:</p>
			<p>Share information with other organisations and public bodies including the police although we only do so in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998</p>
			<p>Check and/or file details with fraud prevention agencies and databases and if we are given false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, we will record this. We and other organisations may also use and search these agencies and databases from the UK and other countries to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Help make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance, credit and related services for you and members of your household,</li>
				<li>Trace debtors or beneficiaries, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies,</li>
				<li>Check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you provide us with other satisfactory proof of identity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.</p>
			<p>We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Checking applications for, and managing credit and other facilities and recovering debt,</li>
				<li>Checking insurance proposals and claims,</li>
				<li>Checking details of job applicants and employees.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We, and other organisations that may access and use information recorded by fraud prevention agencies, may do so from other countries.</p>
			<p>We can provide the names and addresses of the agencies we use if you would like a copy of your information held by them. Please contact: Data Protection Officer at, UKI, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley, BR1 1DP quoting your reference. The agencies may charge a fee.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term08"></a>Financial Sanctions</strong></h3>
			<p>We will use information about you and that of others named on policy to ensure compliance with financial sanctions in effect in the UK and internationally. This will include the checking of your information against the HM Treasury list of financial sanctions targets as well as other publically available sanctions lists. Your information and that of others named on policy may be shared with HM Treasury and other international regulators where appropriate. You may also be contacted in order to provide further details in order to ensure compliance with Financial Sanctions requirements.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term09"></a>Credit Reference Agencies</strong></h3>
			<p>We carry out a consumer search when any application for insurance is submitted to evaluate insurance risks. This is done only using the data that is publically accessible on your credit file (i.e. bankruptcy, CCJ and electoral roll information). Information about access to the public part of your credit file is automatically deleted after 12 months and in no way affects your ability to obtain credit.</p>
			<p>You will have been asked to agree to this when you first contacted us but please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their consent.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term10"></a>Access to your information</strong></h3>
			<p class="tight-bottom">You have the right to see the information we hold about you. This is called Subject Access Request. If you would like a copy of your information, please write to:</p>
			<p><i>Data Access Team</i> at, UKI, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley, BR1 1DP quoting your reference. A fee may be payable.</p>
			<p><a class="scroll-link" href="#privacy-page-top">back to top</a></p>
			<h3><strong><a id="term11"></a>Motor Insurance Database</strong></h3>
			<p>Information relating to your policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). The MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs),</li>
				<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement,</li>
				<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders),</li>
				<li>The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p>
			<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.</p>
			<p>It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. It is our responsibility to update your policy to the MID. We fully comply with the agreements in place with the MIB to update your details within seven days; however it is important that you check your policy documents ensuring that the registration number is recorded correctly.</p>
			<p>If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your car seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number is shown on the MID at www.askMID.com.</p>
			<p>If the registration number is not shown correctly on your policy documents, or you cannot find your car on the MID, please contact us immediately.</p>

			<h2 class="small-spaced-wrapper"><a id="term12"></a>2 - Website Security</h2>
			<p>Any personal data saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially.</p>
			<p>We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*</li>
				<li>It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.</li>
				<li>It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>*There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.</p>
			<p>Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp</a>.</p>
			<p>Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp</a>.</p>

          <h2>What is fraud?</h2>
          <p>
            According to the Association of British Insurers, insurance fraud adds an extra &pound;50 to the insurance bill of the average household.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these tough economic times it is important that we show our commitment to the prevention and detection of fraud to protect our customers and to keep our insurance premiums down.
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of insurance fraud:</p>
        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>
            Application Fraud occurs when a policy holder or applicant either misrepresents or deliberately fails to disclose material facts at policy inception for financial gain.
        </p>
        <p class="tight-bottom">Types of application fraud include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Misrepresentation / Non-Disclosure</strong><br>
                Can include parents taking out insurance policies as the policy holder when their child is actually the main driver, or failing to disclose all accidents/convictions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Claim Discount Fraud</strong><br>
                Falsely claiming to have acquired a greater entitlement of No Claim Discount.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Fraud</strong><br>
                Taking out a policy with no intent to pay. Could be using own and/or stolen payment details.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Claims</h3>
        <p class="tight-bottom">
            Claims fraud is, quite simply, fraud involving claims. There are 2 categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Fictitious losses, incidents or injuries</strong> <br>
                Where a claim is submitted for a loss or incident which did not occur.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Material misrepresentation or exaggeration of a claimed loss or personal injury</strong> <br>
                Where a genuine loss or incident occurs but the claimant deliberately misrepresents or exaggerates the extent of the claim for financial gain.
            </li>
        </ul>

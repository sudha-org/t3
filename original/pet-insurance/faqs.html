                        <p>Any illness or disease that happens during the first 14 days of the policy or any condition that is present before the start date of the policy would not be covered. This includes recurrence of any illness, disease or injury that was present before cover started or that occurred during the first 14 days of your pet being covered.</p>
                        <p>It doesn’t cover any preventative, non-essential or routine treatments or tests, such as flea treatment, neutering and vaccination, behavioural problems, pregnancy, food and dental treatment (unless the dental treatment is due to accidental external injury) and any costs that, as a pet owner, you would normally expect to pay.</p>

                        <p>We offer two levels of cover. Our Essential policy covers each separate condition for 12 months from the first date of treatment, up to a maximum of &pound;4,000 per condition. This policy is suitable for unexpected accidental injuries or for acute conditions that are unlikely to require long-term treatment. Our Advanced policy covers each separate condition up to a maximum of &pound;8,000, with no time limit on reaching this amount. The Advanced policy is suitable for on-going conditions such as arthritis or heart conditions. Treatment for the condition will be covered until the maximum benefit of £8,000 has been reached.</p>
                        <p>Once a pet is insured with us we will continue to insure it. We do not restrict cover or increase the excess due to a pet’s age. Please note that all cover for ongoing claims is subject to the policy remaining in force.</p>

                        <p>We take several factors into account when we calculate our pet insurance premiums. Each customer is rated according to his or her individual circumstances and risk.</p>
                        <p>These factors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The breed of your pet</strong><br />
                            Some breeds are more susceptible to certain medical conditions. For example, some large breeds are more prone to bone and joint problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your pet's age</strong><br />
                            Just like people, older animals are more likely to suffer from certain medical conditions, such as heart disease, kidney problems and arthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Where you live</strong><br />
                            This can influence the level of vets' fees. These are the main reason people claim on their pet insurance and affect pet insurance premiums.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In order to help us keep our premiums down, certain things are not covered by the policy. One of these is the cost of having a pet put to sleep. However, we understand how distressing it is to lose a family pet and we offer a free pet bereavement service, staffed by professionals who can provide counselling and support.</p>

                        <p>Before you take out a policy, read the policy wording and make sure you are happy with the cover it offers. Once you have taken out cover you have 14 days to decide whether it meets your requirements. If you decide to cancel in this period, we will give you a full refund, provided no claims have been made. After 14 days, you can cancel the policy at any time, although we won’t refund any premiums you have already paid. This is because, unlike other insurance policies, cover is paid for on a rolling monthly basis, so you will remain covered until the end of the last month you have already paid for.</p>

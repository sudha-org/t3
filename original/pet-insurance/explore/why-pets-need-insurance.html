                <p>Unfortunately, pets fall ill and have accidents. They might eat things they shouldn’t and get into scrapes. All of which can lead you to the vet's – and some expensive bills.</p>

                <p>If your pet needed emergency or long-term medical treatment, you could end up paying hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. There is no animal NHS to pick up the cost, so pet insurance is becoming increasingly essential as the cost of vets' bills continues to rise.</p>

                <p>The good news is that pet insurance would provide cover for these conditions and more. And it doesn’t have to cost a fortune. While veterinary medicine is getting steadily more sophisticated and expensive, by taking out pet insurance you can avoid most of those unexpected costs.</p>

                <p>Plus, pet insurance can cover you for other unforeseen circumstances. For example, if your dog causes an accident or damage to property, third party liability cover can protect you. Pet insurance can help with kennelling costs if you’re admitted to hospital. It can even help pay towards advertising and a reward if your dog or cat goes missing.</p>

                <p>So what would you do if you were faced with a potentially huge vet’s bill? Look at our pet insurance options and see whether it makes sense for you and your family.</p>

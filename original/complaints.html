				<h2 class="h1-margin">How to make a formal <strong><span class="red">complaint</span></strong></h2>
				<p>The easiest way to complain is simply to give us a call.  If you have a complaint relating to a claim, please call your Claims Advisor, whose number can be found on your claims documentation. For all other complaints, please contact us on:</p>
				<p><strong><span class="red">0800 051 0140</span></strong> and <strong><span class="red">0123 963 6070</span></strong>
				</p>
				<p>If you wish to write, please make sure you choose the right option so that your complaint is dealt with promptly:</p>
				<ul class="coloured-list red-circle">
				<li><strong><span class="red">Claims Complaints</span></strong> should be sent to the Head of Incident Services at the address shown on your claims documentation.</li>
				<li><strong><span class="red">All other complaints</span></strong> should be addressed to the Head of Sales and Customer Service at the address shown on your schedule.</li>

				<h2 class="h1-margin">What happens next?</h2>
				<p>	Our staff will attempt to resolve your complaint immediately. If this isn’t possible, we promise to acknowledge your complaint within 5 business days of receipt. In the unlikely event that your complaint hasn’t been resolved within four weeks of its receipt, we’ll write and let you know the reasons why and the further action we’ll take.</p>
				<p>Within eight weeks of its receipt we’ll either issue you with a final response letter detailing the outcome of our investigation and our decision, or a letter confirming when we anticipate to have concluded our investigation.</p>
				<p>If you’re unhappy with our decision, or if we don’t complete our investigation within eight weeks, you may refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) which, once contacted, will liaise with us on your behalf. The FOS will inform you directly of its decision. Referral to the FOS won’t prejudice your right to take subsequent legal proceedings.</p>

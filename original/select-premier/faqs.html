                <p>It's important to cover your contents for their total value in order to be fully covered in the event of a claim. This may not be theft and could include causes such as fire, flood or burst pipes which may unfortunately result in all of your contents being destroyed. We recognise that SELECT Premier customers are much more likely to require a higher limit for contents cover than many policies provide, which is why we offer £100,000 of cover as standard, with higher limits available if required.</p> 
                <p>If you’re unsure of the amount of cover you need, it can be helpful to write an inventory on a room-by-room basis, taking care not to forget items stored out of sight, such as clothes or books. Our SELECT Premier Customer Advisors are trained to offer specialist advice on the level of contents cover you need.</p>

                <p>Items of jewellery - along with fine art - are collectively known as ‘valuables’ under our policies. It’s important that items are separated from the general contents section of the policy in order to make sure they’re properly covered.</p>

                <p>We recognise that SELECT Premier customers are much more likely to require a higher amount of jewellery cover than a standard policy provides and might also own single expensive rings, necklaces or earrings. Jewellery cover is an important part of our commitment to you so it’s important to make sure they’re fully insured – these items are not only likely to be a significant investment but may also have great sentimental value. Some of the reasons to cover your jewellery include: </p>

                <ul>
                <li>Jewellery is theft-attractive because it’s small in size and easy to dispose of.</li>
                <li>Jewellery is more vulnerable to theft, accidental loss and damage whilst away from home.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the value of these items has increased dramatically over recent years. If the values you’ve placed on these items are out of date, you might not receive their full replacement value in the event of a claim.</p>

                <h3>Good to know:</h3>
                <p>Diamond prices increased 14% on average each year from 1960 to 2014 (Source: Antwerp World Diamond Trade Centre).</p>

                <p>The price of gold increased 15% on average each year over the last 10 years (Source: Gold Price).</p>
                 
                <p>This is why we recommend getting up to date valuations every five years. We have a range of valuation services available, from individual items to whole collections and our SELECT Premier Customer Advisors can help you find the right one for your requirements.</p>

                <p>Items of fine art - along with jewellery - are collectively known as ‘valuables’ under our policies. It’s important that valuables are separated from the general contents section of the policy in order to make sure they’re properly covered. The reason for wanting to separate fine art from contents is that fine art (in the majority of cases) poses less of a risk than many items of general contents (such as electrical goods), which are much easier for thieves to dispose of. They also tend to be treasured possessions, or collections, and therefore greater care is taken of these items. </p>

                <p><h3>What does fine art include?</h3><br>
                Paintings, drawings, prints, etchings, photographs, tapestries, rugs, porcelain, statues, manuscripts, clocks, barometers, antique furniture, collectibles and other works of art with historical value or artistic merit.</p>

                <p>This means the cost to completely rebuild your home and any outbuildings, including materials and labour. This will vary according to the size, age and type of property you live in. We recognise that not everyone will know the rebuild cost of their home, so if it’s of 'standard construction' we offer unlimited buildings rebuild cover, so you can relax knowing you're fully covered. We do this by working with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors to obtain an average rebuild cost for your home, which we then use to work out your premium.</p> 

                <p>In some instances this won’t be possible, for example:
                <ul>
                <li>If your home has more than five bedrooms</li>
                <li>If our home was constructed prior to 1720</li>
                <li>If your home is a listed building</li>
                </ul>

                In these instances we’ll work with you to obtain an accurate rebuild cost. If you recently purchased your home, an up to date rebuild cost will be detailed in the deeds or survey, or alternatively it may have been surveyed separately.</p>

                        <ul class="disc">
                        <li><strong>Fire.</strong> Fire is without doubt the biggest risk when undertaking building works. Most works will represent an increased fire hazard, particularly if they involve a roof extension or plumbing. Even something as simple as a cigarette break could have devastating consequences, so it’s important to make sure appropriate precautions are taken before commencing any work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Theft.</strong> Especially if your home will be unoccupied throughout the duration of the work, or if scaffolding has been erected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Burst or leaking pipes.</strong> For example, if any plumbing work is being undertaken.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liability.</strong> In order to avoid disputes, make sure you know who’s liable for damage or loss to the work whilst in progress and materials stored on site. You could still be held liable in the event of unlawful trespass onto the site, so it’s important to take adequate security measures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storm/weather.</strong> If the work involves knocking through existing walls or roof work then your home may be subject to increased water and wind damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accidental damage.</strong> For example, vibrations from drilling could knock a vase from the shelf or increased dust levels could damage artwork.    </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Existing structure – this will be your responsibility. </li>
                            <li>Contract works – this depends on contract and nature of works. However more often than not this will be the contractor’s property, and therefore theirs to insure, until the date of practical completion. </li>
                            <li>Public and employers’ liability - contractor is liable and must cover the employer in the event of a loss.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><li><h3>When do ‘works’ become ‘existing structure’?</h3>
                    <p>Date of practical completion: “The date certified by the Architect/Contract Administrator when in his opinion the Contractor actually finishes the work to all practical intents and purposes.” It’s at this stage ownership of the completed ‘works’ pass to our insured and should therefore be covered under our contract.</p>

<p>There are no fixed requirements for a SELECT Premier policy, but below are some of the things we might ask for depending on the level of contents you wish to insure:</p>
 
<h3>Locks</h3>
<br>The final exit door may need to be fitted with a 5-lever mortice deadlock or multi-point locking system. In addition we’ll accept multi-point locking systems that are generally fitted to UPVC doors. These provide a similar level of security and are not easily changeable due to the way the doors are manufactured.
Ground floor and accessible windows may need to be fitted with key operated window locks with removable keys for all accessible windows.</p>
 
<h3>Alarm Protection</h3>
<br>There are two types of alarms that are commonly available - an audible or ‘bells only’ alarm and a monitored alarm.</p>
<p>With both types of alarm there’s the option to sign up to a maintenance contract providing the alarm was professionally installed rather then a DIY installation. This will cost on average £50-£80 per year. Where we’re providing a discount to our premium or where we require an alarm to be fitted, we’ll insist upon a maintenance contract to be in place.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bells only alarm.</strong> A bells only alarm is of value as a deterrent and may prevent an attempt at burglary or disrupt a burglary in process. Whilst perfectly adequate for most people, if you need cover for a large amount of contents we may ask for a higher level of security.

<li><strong>Monitored alarm.</strong> Monitored alarms afford increased protection, as triggering the alarm will alert the monitoring station that will in turn alert keyholders nominated by you. Some companies offer a keyholder service that will attend your home and will have available patrols in the middle of the night if needed.

<li><strong>Police Response.</strong> This is an extension to the monitored alarm whereby activation of the alarm will also contact the police. This level of security would only be needed if you have a very large amount of contents to cover.

                If you have a road traffic accident involving your car where you're not to blame, you have a right to claim from the person responsible for the accident.

                Our motor legal protection cover will provide up to &pound;100,000 of legal costs to help you to claim, where no other insurance policy will cover your losses, as long as there is a better than 50% chance that your claim will succeed.

            <p>
                Motor Legal Protection is there for you to help you recover losses you are not covered for by other insurance cover you may have.

            <h2>Reporting your Motor Legal Protection claim</h2>

            <p>You'll need to tell us of your Motor Legal Protection claim when you report your accident to our motor claims department. Your details will then be passed to our specialist Motor Legal claims department who will get your claim moving as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h2>What happens next?</h2>

            <p>The Motor Legal claims department will review the details of your accident and check you have a valid claim under Motor Legal Protection cover. If you have a valid claim, we will confirm that your policy will cover legal costs charged by a solicitor, as long as you follow the solicitor’s advice and there is more than a 50% chance your claim will succeed. A solicitor will then be instructed to act on your behalf to pursue recovery of your losses from the driver responsible. We will cover all the legal costs of this claim in accordance with the policy terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Finalising your claim</h2>

            <p>Most cases are resolved through negotiation, but a minority go to Court. How quickly the claim is settled will depend on the circumstances of the accident, whether the other driver accepts responsibility for the accident and the extent of the injuries or losses being claimed for.</p>

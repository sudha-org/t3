            <p>
                If you make a claim for damage to your car that is a result of vandalism, which is damage caused by a malicious and deliberate act, you will not lose your No Claim Discount.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days it's almost impossible to protect your car from being vandalised. If you're a victim, our vandalism cover comes as standard and now preserves your no claims discount. And we won't just repair the damage; if you go to one of our recommended garages, we'll clean your car inside and out too. After all, it's not your fault if you're a victim - so why should you suffer twice?
            </p>
            <h2>Conditions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You pay the excess</li>
                <li>The incident is reported to the police and assigned a crime reference number.</li>
                <li>The damage has not been caused by another vehicle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you claim you will have to pay the excess. Once we receive your claim, you may lose your No Claim Discount, until we are supplied with a relevant crime reference number.
            </p>
            <p>
                This promise is for comprehensive policy holders only. Please remember that vandalism should be reported to your local police station unless you are reporting it immediately as an emergency.
            </p>

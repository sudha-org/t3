            <p>
                The trouble with being a young driver is that <a href="/car-insurance">car insurance policies</a> cost more than they will later in life &ndash; just when you want the fastest car on the planet in which to show off. You&rsquo;ll realise after a moment&rsquo;s thought that this is actually a good thing&hellip;
            </p>
            <p>
                There are ways of getting lower premiums for young and new drivers. For a cheaper quote, think about the car that you&rsquo;re going to buy. The older and slower it is, the cheaper the insurance will be. If it&rsquo;s quite old and its price was low, it might also be worth opting for Third party fire and theft cover. This covers you if other people claim against you for injury or damage to their car or property, and if you car is stolen or damaged by fire. It may be worth buying a car that is in an insurance group of between 1 and 4, as these will have lower insurance premiums than other cars.

                The figures on young people&rsquo;s driving are serious. According to the Association of British Insurers, although there was an 8 per cent decline in the overall number of people killed on Britain&rsquo;s roads in 2004, there was a 12 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 19 year-old drivers and passengers killed in the same year. Inevitably, this has pushed up the premiums for younger drivers. Also, according to Pass Plus, one in five young drivers is expected to be involved in an accident during their first year of driving.

                The best way to get <a href="/car-insurance">lower insurance</a> over a period of time is to drive safely. Think about practical things you can do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Observe motoring regulations at all times &ndash; exceeding the speed limit and failing to adhere to the Highway Code is dangerous and could cost lives
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our <a href="/car-insurance">car insurance</a> means that you could earn a No Claims Bonus even though you are insured on your parents&rsquo; policy
                </li>
                <li>Be the only driver on your policy to keep the costs down.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Car insurance premiums will be higher at first because inexperienced and young drivers seem to have more accidents than older, experienced drivers. Check the cover we offer, and look at how speedily we deal with any claims &ndash; we think you&rsquo;ll be impressed.

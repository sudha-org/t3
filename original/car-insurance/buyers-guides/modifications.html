                Making changes to your car could increase the cost of your insurance
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Thinking about making changes to your car? Think carefully before you get started because it could increase your insurance premiums.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Whether it's a new sound system or tinted windows, there are plenty of ways to modify your car. Making alterations can be expensive though, and could also increase the cost of your insurance premium.
            </p>
            <h2>How it affects the cost of insurance</h2>
            <p>
                Statistics show that when changes are made to a car, such as an enhanced exhaust system, it's more likely to be subject to an insurance claim.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why <strong>insurers tend to increase the cost of your premiums</strong> when you make any changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exact amount you'll need to pay on top of your insurance will depend on many factors including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the type of car</li>
                <li>the modifications you're planning to make</li>
                <li>the age of the driver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some changes won't affect your premiums, such as installing a new alarm &ndash; so it's worth checking with your insurer before you do any work.
            </p>
            <h2>Let your insurer know your plans</h2>
            <p>
                Some things will impact your insurance policy so you'll need to &amp; tell your insurer before you start work.
            </p>
            <p>
                These include any changes to the appearance or performance of the car, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>tinted windows</li>
                <li>new sound systems</li>
                <li>spoilers</li>
                <li>alloy wheels</li>
                <li>body kits</li>
                <li>new engine</li>
                <li>re-spraying the bodywork</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are plenty of other changes you'll need to tell them about too, so it's a good idea to check your insurance policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't tell your insurer about any of these changes, claims could be rejected or your policy declared void.
            </p>

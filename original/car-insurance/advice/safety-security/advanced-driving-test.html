            <p>The Advanced Driving Test helps you be a better driver and comes with a host of benefits...</p>
            <h2>So what is the Advanced Driving Test?</h2>
            <p>
                In a bid to raise driving standards and promote road safety in the UK, the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) initiated the Advanced Driving Test in 1956. Based on the &lsquo;Roadcraft&rsquo; system of car control, as taught in Home Office Approved Police Driving Schools, it is designed to teach drivers how to operate their cars smoothly, safely and systematically &ndash; and with speed and sparkle &ndash; despite the conditions and traffic on the road. It sounds like simple common sense, but statistics show that drivers who have passed their Advanced Test have a 50% to 75% less chance of causing an accident. If you are involved in an accident, however, all types of Direct Line Motor Insurance include an Accident Action Pack and access to a 24 Hour Accident Helpline. Optional Motor Legal Protection is also available with Comprehensive cover.
            </p>
            <h2>What&rsquo;s in it for me?</h2>
            <p>
                Being a better driver means fewer accidents so you get to keep your No Claims Bonus for longer. With Direct Line Motor Insurance you get a No Claims Discount (NCD) of 30% after one year, 65% after five years, and after four years you can protect your NCD further for a small premium. More economical driving means less wear and tear on your engine and components, which means cheaper motoring. Less stress placed on the car also helps to reduce fuel consumption, therefore making your driving greener. Advanced Drivers also agree that being more observant of your position on the road helps you spot realistic opportunities that otherwise you might hesitate to take. Plus, added confidence helps you enjoy driving more.
            </p>
            <h2>Where do I take my test?</h2>
            <p>
                The Advanced Driving Test lasts for about 90 minutes and covers a range of urban and country roads, plus motorways where possible. Your Examiner will hold a Police Advanced Driving certificate (either serving or ex Police Class 1) and will have extensive experience from working within the Traffic sections of the Police Force. For details of Advanced Tests, plus membership information and additional benefits, visit the <a href="http://www.iam.org.uk" title="IAM" target="_blank">IAM</a> or the <a href="http://www.rospa.com" title="Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) website" target="_blank">Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IAM and RoSPA maintain that minimising accidents through Advanced Driving can help reduce your insurance premium by protecting your No Claims Bonus.

            <h2>Five other good reasons to take your Advanced Driving Test</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the UK, 10 people are killed in road accidents each day and 100 are seriously injured
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 17 to 21 age group makes up only 10% of licence holders, but is involved in more than 20% of all accidents
                </li>
                <li>
                    More than 270,000 drivers have passed the IAM Advanced Driving Test and statistics show that their chances of having an accident are cut by two-thirds
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every 90 seconds of every day and night, another person is injured in a traffic accident &ndash; nearly 1,000 road accidents per day
                </li>
                <li>An estimated 95% of road accidents are due to driver error</li>

			<p>Good to know - life insurance is provided by Legal & General</p>
			<p>Life insurance can be one of those things we put off buying. You might only think about it when something significant happens, like moving house or having a baby. But the sooner you think about life insurance the better, because generally you'll pay less the younger you are. Even one year could make a difference to the premiums you’ll pay.</p>
			<p>Your life insurance quote is based on your individual circumstances. The price is based on factors including your:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Age</li>
				<li>Smoker status</li>
				<li>Health</li>
				<li>Lifestyle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Life insurance is calculated on risk factors, and the higher the risk, the more it will cost. If you’re young, fit and healthy your premiums are usually lower, but as you get older and your medical history changes they are likely to be higher.</p>
			<p>As premiums are fixed for the term of the policy (unless you change your plan), buying now means you’ll keep that price.</p>
			<p>Here’s an example of how life insurance premiums can increase as we get older:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Quote for a Level Term Assurance policy <br>£100,000 amount of cover and 15 year term</th>
					<th>DOB</th>
					<th>Premium</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>30 year old non smoker</td>
					<td>01/06/1984</td>
					<td>£6.03</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>40 year old non smoker</td>
					<td>01/06/1974</td>
					<td>£9.42</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>50 year old non smoker</td>
					<td>01/06/1964</td>
					<td>£18.69</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Prices correct as of 1 July 2014 for existing Direct Line customers. Remember the price may change based on the answers in the application.</p>
			<p>And buying a policy earlier doesn’t mean that you have to stick with the same cover if it no longer meets your needs. Direct Line Life Insurance, provided by Legal & General, lets you <a href="/life-insurance/advice/change-policy-details">make changes to your policy</a> in certain circumstances.</p>

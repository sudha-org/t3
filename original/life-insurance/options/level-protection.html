			<p>Good to know – life insurance is provided by Legal & General</p>
			<p>Level Term Assurance cover means your premiums and cash sum payout stay the same, unless you make changes to your policy. Designed to help protect your family financially, life insurance can pay out a cash sum if you die during the policy term – your loved ones can use it however they wish.</p>
			<p>Did you know that Level Term Assurance can also help cover an "interest only" type mortgage?</p>
			<p><strong>Main features at a glance:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Premiums start at £6 per month, and stay fixed throughout your policy, unless you make changes to your policy. This lets you budget with confidence.</li>
				<li>Level Term Assurance cover means your cash sum payout stays the same.</li>
				<li>You choose how much you want to be covered for. If you’re unsure take a look at the <a href="/life-insurance/explore/cover-calculator">Life insurance calculator</a>, designed to help you decide.</li>
				<li>Terminal Illness Cover could pay out your chosen amount of cover if you're diagnosed with a terminal illness and have a life expectancy of 12 months or less. This cover is not available during the last 12 months of your policy or for terms of less than 2 years.

				<li>This is not a savings or investment product and has no cash value unless a valid claim is made.</li>

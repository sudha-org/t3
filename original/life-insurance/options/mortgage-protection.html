			<h1 class="h1-margin">Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</h1>
			<p>Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance is designed to help cover a repayment -capital and interest mortgage. This means the amount you’re covered for reduces roughly in line with the way a repayment mortgage decreases but your premiums stay the same. It may be a cheaper option when compared to a Level Term Assurance policy.</p>
			<p>Main features at a glance:</p>
			<p>Premiums start from £6 a month and stay fixed throughout your policy, unless you alter your policy.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Premiums start from £6 a month and stay fixed throughout your policy, unless you alter your policy.</li>
				<li>Terminal Illness Cover could pay out your chosen amount of cover if you're diagnosed with a terminal illness and have a life expectancy of 12 months or less. This cover is not available during the last 12 months of your policy or for terms of less than 2 years. Please read the policy Terms and Conditions for more information</li>
				<li>You can add <a href="/life-insurance/options/critical-illness">Critical Illness Cover</a> for an extra cost when you take out a life policy, giving you extra protection. This covers 41 conditions.</li>
				<li>Guaranteed Insurability Option lets you increase your cover as your circumstances change, for example if you got married, entered into a registered civil partnership, or you move house. Please read the policy Terms and Conditions for more information.</li>
				<li>Free Life cover if you're buying a property- between exchange of contracts and completion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Need more information? We’ve written a few <a href="/life-insurance/explore">articles and guides</a> that might help you make a decision. Or <a href="/life-insurance/options">compare our policies</a>. You can also check to see if you are <a href="/life-insurance/eligibility">eligible to apply</a>.</p>
			<p>Things you need to know:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you intentionally take your own life in the first 12 months of your cover, your policy will be cancelled and will not pay out. However all premiums paid will be refunded.</li>
				<li>This is not a savings or investment product and has no cash value unless a valid claim is made.</li>
				<li>If you stop paying premiums before the end of your policy, your cover will end 30 days after your missed payment.</li>
				<li>Check that the policy term is long enough to cover the duration of your mortgage term, otherwise you might not be fully protected.</li>
				<li>If you choose Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance there are some circumstances when the cash sum paid out might not be enough to pay off your mortgage in full. For example if your mortgage interest rate averages over 10% during the policy term or if you change your mortgage.</li>
				<li>Please read the policy Terms & Conditions before you apply.</li>
				<li>It is your responsibility to make sure the policy meets your needs. If you require advice please contact a financial adviser. Keep in mind, you may be charged for any advice provided.</li>

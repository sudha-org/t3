			<p>Good to know - life insurance is provided by Legal & General</p>
			<p>All life insurance is the same… isn’t it? This is a common thought, but it isn’t true. There are various types of life insurance available, and they're usually designed with a specific protection purpose in mind.</p>
			<p>At Direct Line, we offer two types of life insurance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/life-insurance/options/level-protection">Level Term Life Insurance</a> </li>
				<li><a href="/life-insurance/options/mortgage-protection">Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Neither option offers better cover than the other, but you might find one suits your needs more closely. You can apply for both types of life insurance if you wish, subject to certain limits. You are also allowed to own several life insurance policies, even if this includes policies not with Direct Line. </p>
			<h2>Level Term Assurance</h2>
			<p><a href="/life-insurance/options/level-protection">Level Term Assurance</a> is usually the preferred choice to help make sure your family has financial protection if you die during the policy term. This is because it lets you choose how much cover you need, and the length of time you want to be insured for – the amount of cover will not change unless you alter your policy. And so you always know how much it will pay out.</p>
			<h2>Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</h2>
			<p><a href="/life-insurance/options/mortgage-protection">Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</a> policies are suitable for helping to repay a capital and interest type mortgage if you die during the policy term. This way your family wouldn’t have to worry about how they’d pay the mortgage after you’d gone.</p>
			<p>With Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance the amount you’re covered for decreases over time, so the amount of cover reduces roughly in line with the way a repayment mortgage decreases.</p>
			<!-- <p>Take a look at the diagram below – it shows how Level Term Assurance cover stays the same over time, whereas Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance reduces over the policy term.</p> -->
			<h2>Do you want the best of both?</h2>
			<p>You can apply for both types of life insurance if you wish</p>
<!-- 			<h3>Level Cover vs Decreasing Cover Comparison</h3>
			<img src="" />
			<p>The graph above compares a policy that covers £100,000 over 25 years and shows the differences between Level and Decreasing Cover. In this example, if a claim is made after 20 years, the payment provided under a Decreasing policy would be £40,000, whereas a Level policy would pay £100,000.</p>
			<p>These figures are for illustrative purposes only. You can find the interest rate for your cover in your Personal Illustration and your Policy Schedule.</p> -->

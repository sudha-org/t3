                        <p>This depends on the whether you take out Level or Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance, the amount of cover you take, and the length of the policy you choose. Your choices need to be made after you consider your mortgage product, outstanding mortgage and mortgage term. If you have an interest-only mortgage, your outstanding mortgage loan stays the same until you repay it at the end of the mortgage term. <a href="/life-insurance/options/level-protection" title="Level Term Assurance">Level Term Assurance</a> could cover this type of mortgage. If you have a repayment mortgage, <a href="/life-insurance/options/mortgage-protection" title="Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance">Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</a> may be more appropriate. The amount of cover reduces broadly in line with the decrease in your outstanding mortgage loan.

                        <p>No, your policy can only pay out once. This would happen on diagnosis of a specified critical illness or on death during the policy term. Your policy ends once a valid claim has been made and the cash sum paid out. There is an exception to this if your claim is for carcinoma in situ of the breast treated by surgery, low-grade prostate cancer requiring treatment, or a children's critical illness claim. The policy will continue as normal after a pay out in one of these circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Yes. Putting your life insurance policy in trust means that any life cover cash sum can go to the people you choose. Your chosen beneficiaries could receive the cash sum without the need for probate to be granted. And, under current tax rules, it could help protect the cash sum from Inheritance Tax.</p>

                        <p>A trust is a way of giving away something of value (the asset) for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries) but without giving them full access to and control over it. The trust specifies who may benefit from the asset. The trust will also specify who you want to look after and control the asset (the trustees). To put your policy in trust please <a href="/life-insurance/contact-us" title="get in touch">get in touch</a>. If you need help setting up a trust, please contact your financial or legal adviser.</p>

                        It's important that you answer the question honestly. Please answer ’Yes‘ if you have used any of these at all in the last 12 months, even if you only consider yourself to be a social smoker (e.g. during occasional evenings out or weekends). Nicotine replacements include patches and e-cigarettes.<br /><br /></li>

                        <li><strong>How often do you drink alcohol?</strong><br /><br />

                        We'll ask you some questions about alcohol. It'll include how often you drink alcohol, and how much you drink. We'll also need to know whether you have been told to stop or cut down the amount of alcohol you drink for medical reasons. And whether you need specialist help for alcohol consumption.</li>

                        When placing the policy in trust you specify who you want to be a beneficiary and who you want to look after and control the policy (the trustees). A trust is a way of giving away something of value (in this case the life insurance policy) for the benefits of others (the beneficiaries), but without giving them full access to and control over the policy. If you wish to proceed with a trust arrangement, please contact <a title="Legal & General" href="http://www.legalandgeneral.com" target="_blank">Legal & General</a>.</p>
                        <p>If you’re unsure whether a Trust is the right option for you, it’s important you discuss this with a legal adviser, who may charge you.</p>

            <p>
                When you rent a property, arranging the <a href="/home-insurance/options/buildings-cover">buildings insurance</a>, which covers the structure of your home along with fixtures and fittings such as the kitchen or bathroom units is usually down to your landlord. However, the contents of your home &ndash; those items owned by you &ndash; are your responsibility. With Direct Line, we can provide tenants with <a href="/home-insurance/options/contents-cover">contents insurance</a> providing the property is furnished with contents owned by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contents insurance covers your household goods from furniture to more valuable items. Unfortunately Direct Line cannot cover you if you live in a rented property that is furnished by your landlord. If you are not sure of your status in this case, speak to your landlord first.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a tenant and eligible for contents insurance we provide cover for loss and damage of household goods &ndash; through fire, smoke damage, lightning, theft, flood and escape of water and oil. We cover cash in your home up to &pound;500 and items in your garden up to &pound;1,000. Contents insurance also covers against freezer contents as standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct Line contents cover is provided on a new for old basis, whether you are a tenant or not. To make sure you have adequate cover, you can use the home contents calculator online. Remember, you need to give us the replacement value of items when you apply for a quote.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cover is increased automatically during the period of a wedding and Christmas, and there is a 24 hour emergency helpline in case disaster strikes.
            </p>
            <p>

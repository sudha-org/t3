            <h2>Cover your jewellery with Direct Line</h2>
            <p>
                Insuring your jewellery is important. Some people don&rsquo;t realise how much their jewellery may actually be worth and so sorting out insurance may not be something they think about. So it makes sense to cover your jewellery with a Direct Line <a href="/home-insurance/options/contents-cover">contents insurance</a> policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct Line offers different levels of contents insurance, depending on how much your jewellery collection is worth. The table below shows what each policy covers individual items of jewellery for as standard:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Home Insurance Contents Policy</th>
                        <th>Home Insurance Plus Contents Policy</th>
                        <th>SELECT Premier</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&pound;2,000</td>
                        <td>&pound;4,000</td>
                        <td>&pound;10,000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><a href="http://css.directline.com/insurance/home/startaction.do?entrypoint=0001&productline=0031" target="_blank"><strong>Get a Quote</strong></a></td>
                        <td><a href="http://css.directline.com/insurance/home/startaction.do?entrypoint=0001&productline=0031" target="_blank"><strong>Get a Quote</strong></a></td>
                        <!-- add select premier modal in on click of get a quote -->
                        <td><a href="/select-premier/_select-premier-interim" data-reveal-id="modal-select-interim"><strong>Get a Quote</strong></a></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                You could still cover your items of jewellery under any of these policies if they are valued at more than these amounts, you just have to specify them individually when you take out the policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you require over &pound;20,000 of jewellery cover, you may wish to consider our SELECT Premier policy. <a href="/select-premier/options#slide-1">SELECT Premier home insurance</a> offers specialist cover for valuable items such as jewellery and fine art and there is no need to specify any items under &pound;10,000 in value.
            </p>
            <h2>Get extra cover for your jewellery:</h2>
            <p>
                You can add another level of protection by opting to take <a href="/home-insurance/extras/personal-possessions">Personal Possessions cover</a> with your Direct Line Home Insurance contents policy. A Direct Line Home Insurance Plus contents policy comes with up to &pound;5,000 of Personal Possessions cover as standard. This cover insures any items that you would normally take outside your home or on holiday, including jewellery, against accidental loss or damage and theft anywhere in the UK and for up to 60 days elsewhere in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have suffered a break-in or had property stolen from outside the home, you should first call the police, then either call our claims department on <strong>0845 246 8412</strong>.

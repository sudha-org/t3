            <p>
                So, you&rsquo;ve found the house of your dreams and everything about it seems perfect, from the number of bedrooms, to the location. But have you paid enough attention to the garden and what&rsquo;s in it? Did you notice the trees?
            </p>
            <p>
                Trees bring with them many benefits &ndash; but they also have their downfalls. Their shade can lead to patchy lawns and dark rooms, and fallen leaves can block drains and make your garden seem messy. And did you know that many trees are legally protected? So if you think that once you move in you can just chop down the mature oak that&rsquo;s blocking the sunlight from your new front room, you&rsquo;ll have to think again. Moving in to a house with mature trees in the garden, or even in the neighbours&rsquo; gardens, has consequences, and it&rsquo;s important to understand them before you invest in a property.
            </p>
            <h2>What to consider</h2>
            <p>
                Leaves, twigs, fruit litter, pollen and dead branches can all cause problems in their own rights, not least all the mess they can make of your garden. Glass-roofed outhouses are in particular danger of damage from falling branches or heavy fruit, a factor that needs to be considered if you want to build a conservatory or put in a greenhouse.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it&rsquo;s unlikely that tree roots will damage foundations or drains, it does sometimes happen, especially if a house is built on very heavy clay soils or peat. To be sure that this isn&rsquo;t already happening to your potential new property, it is always worth obtaining a full structural survey before you make an offer.
            </p>
            <h2>Are the trees protected?</h2>
            <p>
                If you do decide to purchase the property with the plan of felling any trees that you don&rsquo;t wish to keep, make sure you check whether or not the tree is protected by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO), as if it is, you will need to apply to the council for consent to do anything to it. Each case will be decided on its own merits and you&rsquo;ll be expected to present a justifiable reason for felling it, such as it being dead, diseased or dangerous. But be warned: simply not liking the tree would not be accepted as a good reason for chopping it down, and just because it is large and close to your house, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will be considered dangerous. Similarly, although it is possible that tree roots could cause your drive to crack, be aware that this might not be a valid reason for severing the roots or felling the tree if it is protected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, if your house is in a Conservation Area, then the trees are also protected and you must give your local authority six weeks&rsquo; notice before felling or pruning, so that the tree officer can decide whether a TPO should be placed. Cutting a tree with a TPO &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t realise it has one &ndash; can lead to a fine of up to &pound;30,000, or twice the value of the tree&rsquo;s timber, whichever is greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any TPOs should show up during your solicitor&rsquo;s local survey before you exchange contracts.
            </p>
            <h2>A positive asset</h2>
            <p>
                Even if you&rsquo;re not keen on them, many people seek properties with mature trees in their gardens and they could improve the resale value of your house. Trees, properly managed, are beneficial to our environment and encourage wildlife, especially in urban areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need any more information about trees and how they affect a property, your council&rsquo;s tree officer will answer any questions you have.

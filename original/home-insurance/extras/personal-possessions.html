            <p>Home <a href="#" title="contents insurance">contents insurance</a> covers things that you usually keep at home. It doesn't cover things away from home if they're lost, damaged or stolen.</p>

            <p>We get claims for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Phones left in taxis</li>
                <li>Cameras lost on holiday</li>
                <li>Rings and jewellery that slip off in the sea</li>
                <li>Wallets and purses left in the supermarket by mistake</li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>To insure against these kind of things, you'd need to add Personal Possessions cover. It's there to help when you're out and about.</p>

            <h2>What else would Personal Possessions cover me for?</h2>

            <p>Things like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Leaving your iPod on the train</li>
                <li>Having your watch stolen from a hotel room</li>
            </ul>
             
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <p>Personal Possessions cover insures a whole family that lives at the same address. So if you took it out, all your family's things would be covered away from home.</p>

            <p>It covers you anywhere in the British Isles, and for up to 60 days abroad in any one policy year. And it includes up to £500 worth of cash cover.</p>

            <p>To work out how much cover you'd need, add up the value of all of the things you and your family take outside. Don't forget clothes and jewellery. Anything worth over £2,000 needs to be individually listed.</p>

            <p>If you'd like more cover, you could take out Home Insurance Plus. Its Personal Possessions cover guards up to £1,000 in cash. And you only need to name things worth over £4,000. It includes up to £1,000 per bike as standard.</p>

            <p>If you would like our highest level of cover, for customers with £100,000 of contents and above, <a href="/home-insurance/options#select-premier-insurance" title="SELECT Premier home insurance">SELECT Premier home insurance</a> covers your contents for loss or damage whilst away from the home anywhere in the world (for up to 60 consecutive days).</p>

            <h2>Is there anything Personal Possessions cover won't cover against?</h2>

            <p>Yes. It doesn't cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wear and tear</li>
                <li>Things that are damaged through everyday use (eg sports equipment)</li>
                <li>Things stolen from cars or vans, unless they're out of sight and someone had to break in to find them. (So a handbag that's locked in the boot and can't be seen from the street would be covered. But a Tom-Tom that's there on the dashboard wouldn't).</li>
                <li>Pets and other animals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It doesn't cover things that are used for business, either. That would include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Business cash, credit or debit cards</li>
                <li>Tools, even if they're locked up and can't be seen.</li>
            </ul>

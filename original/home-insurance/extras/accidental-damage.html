            <p>Accidental damage cover can provide you with additional cover for the things that may not be covered in your home insurance policy, such as DIY disasters!</p>

            <p><a href="/home-insurance/options#home-insurance" title="Direct Line Home insurance">Direct Line Home insurance</a> does not include accidental damage cover as standard. You can easily add Accidental Damage cover to either your standard contents and/or buildings policy.</p>

            <p><a href="/home-insurance/options#home-insurance-plus" title="Direct Line Home Insurance Plus">Direct Line Home Insurance Plus</a> (a higher level of home insurance cover) does include accidental damage cover as standard.</p>

            <p><a href="/home-insurance/options#select-premier-insurance" title="Direct Line SELECT Premier Home Insurance">Direct Line SELECT Premier Home Insurance</a> (our highest level of home insurance cover, for customers with Â£100,000 of contents and above) also includes accidental damage cover as standard.</p>  

            <h2>So what do they cover?</h2>

            <h3>Accidental Damage cover for Contents</h3>

            <p>Accidental damage cover for contents can cover you against things like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A computer keyboard killed by a cup of coffee</li>
                <li>Hot iron falls off an ironing board and scorches a carpet</li>
                <li>Carpets ruined by red wine spills</li>
                <li>Jammed DVD players, with toys stuck inside</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you add accidental damage cover to your contents insurance, you'd be covered for things like this when they happen.</p>
            
            <h2>Accidental Damage cover for Buildings</h2>

            <p>Accidental damage cover for Buildings is there to cover against things like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Footballs kicked through windows</li>
                <li>Cracked bathroom sinks. (Toothbrush mugs can cause damage).</li>
                <li>Feet through the floor when you're up in the loft</li>
                <li>Leaky gas or water pipes, if you bang a nail in where you shouldn't. (This add-on cover's very handy if you're into DIY).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What wouldn't be insured if I had Accidental Damage cover for Contents and Buildings?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Wear and tear. Like a much-loved, but well-worn sofa when the fabric eventually gives way and rips</li>
                <li>'Mechanical Failure'. A computer that dies and won't come back to life.</li>
                <li>Bad workmanship. (The electrician wires a socket wrong).</li>
                <li>Damage caused by lodgers, or guests paying to stay with you.</li>
                <li>Damage caused by pets.</li>
                <li>Damage caused by cleaning or repairing something.</li>
                <li>Items taken outside the home. Such as jewellery or a mobile phone that gets damaged or lost (for that cover, see our Personal Possessions cover).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Understand the cover level most suited to your needs</h2>

            <p>Not everything's covered, so always check the policy before you buy.</p>

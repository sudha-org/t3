            <h2>How DataPatrol works</h2>
            <p class="tight">DataPatrol monitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal information: name, usernames, aliases and email addresses;</li>
                <li>Your contact information: home address, other addresses and telephone numbers;</li>
                <li>
                    Your financial information: credit/debit cards, bank details, online banking IDs and online shopping IDs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tight">
                DataPatrol searches for your vital information across a variety of data sources, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public Websites</li>
                <li>Compromised and stolen data traded on Internet</li>
                <li>Public registers and Companies House (excluding Channel Isles and Isle of Man)</li>
                <li>Electoral Roll (excluding Channel Isles and Isle of Man)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If DataPatrol finds anything that could put you at risk, you&rsquo;ll be contacted immediately by email and text and given assistance on what you need to do to protect yourself from fraud.
            </p>
            <h2>How to register and start protecting yourself:</h2>
            <p>
                You must hold a Direct Line Home Insurance Plus policy to benefit from Identity and Online Fraud Assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To activate this service you'll need to register at <a href="http://www.garlik.com/dlplus" target="_blank">www.garlik.com/dlplus</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll be asked for your policy number so make sure you have this handy. Once you&rsquo;re logged in, you'll be able to set up your DataPatrol account. You can add as much information as you want to monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once registered, DataPatrol will start to monitor for your details, even if you&rsquo;ve only registered your name and address. The more information you enter, such as your credit card numbers, passport number, driver&rsquo;s license number, the more DataPatrol monitor and alert you to any possible risk of ID theft and fraud.

            <h1 class="h1-margin">Travel insurance cover for over 65&rsquo;s</h1>
            <p>
                Just because you&rsquo;ve reached a certain age, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re less likely to travel abroad. In fact, if you have recently retired you may have more time and money to make trips. You may even have a holiday home abroad in which you spend part of the year. You also want to make sure any breaks you take are relaxing and stress-free. That&rsquo;s why <a href="/travel-insurance">Direct Line travel insurance</a> doesn&rsquo;t stop at 65.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our <a href="/travel-insurance/single-trip">Single Trip Travel Insurance</a> provides cover for those of you over 65. This includes cover of up to &pound;1,500 of personal possessions and &pound;500 of personal money per person per trip. It also covers you for up to &pound;10 million per person for medical and emergency expenses abroad, plus up to &pound;5,000 for cancellation and curtailment and up to &pound;25,000 for personal accident cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other items covered under <a href="/travel-insurance">Direct Line&rsquo;s Travel Insurance</a> include personal liability, delayed departure, loss of passport, legal assistance, essential replacement item, abandoned journey, and winter sports cover for those who specify it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct Line does require information about your health if you are taking out travel insurance. Pre-existing medical conditions need to be specified. If you do not give us all the relevant information, you may end up under-insured. This could cost you a fortune in medical bills should something go wrong. So if you have a query, just give us a call to make sure you have the <a href="/travel-insurance/summary">correct level of cover</a> to suit your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a partner (under or over 65), you can apply for joint Travel Insurance. In fact, single trip travel policies can include up to 15 people (as long as you are not travelling as a professional team), which is great if you enjoy taking group trips or weekend breaks with your friends. For extra peace of mind, your Direct Line Travel Insurance can also cover you for short breaks in the UK.
            </p>

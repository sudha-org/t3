             Subsidence, damp, dry and wet rot, and woodworm can all affect a building's structure. Here's what to look out for.

            <h2>Subsidence</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                Subsidence happens when unstable soil causes the foundations to sink. Clay soil is particularly vulnerable and long periods of dry weather can also contribute. 'Heave', on the other hand, is when the ground swells because of increased moisture and the foundations rise.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I tell if I have it?</h3>
            <p>
                Remember, cracks in walls don't necessarily indicate subsidence. All houses have these and many are due to settlement, which is caused by the weight of the building. Grouting or sealing is usually all that's needed to fill minor cracks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subsidence cracks are normally 1mm or more wide. They are often wider at the top than at the bottom. Watch out for a series of small, often diagonal cracks suddenly appearing in plasterwork, around doors and windows or between different parts of the property, especially after long periods of dry weather.
            </p>
            <h3>How do I fix it?</h3>
            <p>
                If you're worried, contact your insurer straight away. If you're buying a home and think there's a risk, commission a RICS/ISVA Home Buyer's Report. In a few extreme cases you may need to replace or deepen the foundations.

            <h2>Damp</h2>
            <h3>There are three main types of damp:</h3>

                    <p class="icon-list-item"><strong>Rising damp</strong> is the most common. It's caused by moisture from the ground rising through the walls. It can loosen plaster and cause stains on internal walls. Rising damp only reaches up to one metre above ground level.</p>

        <div class="small-10 end small-centered large-8 columns">
         <h3>Shouldn't I already be protected against damp?</h3>
         <p>
             Normally walls are protected against rising damp by a damp proof course built into the wall, unless the property is very old.
         </p>
         <h3>How do I cure it?</h3>
         <p>
             For rising damp, you inject a chemical damp proof course and re-plaster the internal walls with a waterproof layer up to 1.2 metres high.
         </p>
         <h3>How do I know if I have it?</h3>
         <p>
             You can commission a report from specialist damp companies. They usually provide this free as part of their quotation process.

                            <strong>Fungal decay</strong> which is more commonly known as dry rot and wet rot:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dry rot</strong> needs a moisture content of over 20% for the spores to develop and spread. In extreme cases the timber becomes so brittle it can be broken up by hand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wet rot</strong> needs a higher moisture content (40-50%) and becomes dormant in dryer conditions. It doesn't usually spread to other materials, but it stains wood and causes splits and cracks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="small-spaced-wrapper">
                            To treat rot, you must first remove the sources of damp. You may need to repair or replace affected timber and you should treat all timber with fungicide.

                            , which are wood-boring insects that lay their eggs on or in timber. The hatching larvae then bore through the wood. You treat woodworm with insecticides.

                            An attack has to be very severe to warrant replacing or repairing structural timbers. Usually treatment of the rot is enough. The same specialist companies that handle damp work often also cover timber problems and reports.

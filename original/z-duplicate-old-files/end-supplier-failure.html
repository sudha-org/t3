            <h1 class="h1-margin">Airline &amp; end supplier failure cover</h1>
            <p>
                We are constantly evolving our travel policies to take into account what is needed by our customers in today's marketplace, and we are sure you will agree that this new cover is a valued addition to our excellent travel insurance products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Airline and end supplier failure cover fills the gap in consumer protection relating to end suppliers of holidays for direct bookings which may fall outside the Governments ATOL (Air Travel Organiser's Licence) and has been included on all Direct Line Travel Insurance Policies with the exception of Direct Line Home Plus policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                ATOL covers bookings where a flight plus another component part of the trip are booked at the same time, but with a growing volume of our customers booking directly with airlines, hotels and other end suppliers which will not be covered by ATOL, our policy does cover the failure of these end suppliers.
            </p>
            <p class="tight">You are now protected against the pre-booked collapse of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accommodation Suppliers</li>
                <li>Airlines</li>
                <li>Car Hire firms</li>
                <li>Excursion providers</li>
                <li>Theme parks</li>
                <li>Train/Ferry companies</li>
                <li>Villa Owners</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                There is no excess to pay for this cover, just peace of mind that in the event of an un-bonded collapse, anything not protected elsewhere can be claimed from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                With over 50 airlines collapsing in the last 12 months, plus a multitude of other suppliers falling due the recession, we think that this protection is essential to give you peace of mind when travelling and making your bookings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cover is provided through <a href="http://www.ipplondon.co.uk" target="_blank">International  Passenger Protection Ltd</a> and arranged via a panel of Insurers.

            <p>
                While there are people who are happy to spend their holidays lying on a Spanish beach, there are those require a little more adventure. And the adventure market is one that continues to grow. One quick search on the Internet reveals a whole world of possibilities &ndash; from white water kayaking and mountain trekking, to scuba diving and extreme snowboarding.

                Of course, as your holidays become more adventurous, the risk of injury increases. Tales of accidents and broken bones while taking part in adventure holidays are commonplace, and if you don&rsquo;t have the right travel insurance, it can be costly. According to the website Cultural Cube, if you break a leg while on holiday in the USA, inpatient treatment will set you back around &pound;10,000, while an air ambulance repatriation to the UK could cost anything up to &pound;35,000.

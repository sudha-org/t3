            <p>
                Thinking about buying a new car? Now you have more eco-friendly choices than ever before &ndash; electric, hybrid or biofuel cars are all great options. And keep in mind that all-electric cars are exempt from road tax. Why don&rsquo;t you consider a vehicle with a 1.4 litre engine or smaller? All new cars are tested to check that their exhaust emissions meet European standards, so as a general rule, the newer the car the lower the emissions.

            <p>
                Converting your petrol engine to run on Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) would probably mean lower toxic emissions. It costs around &pound;1,000 but you would notice a big saving per litre at the pumps. And whether you have a petrol or diesel engine, you can also convert them to run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which emits fewer toxic chemicals. Cars with diesel engines use less fuel and don&rsquo;t give out as much CO2 as their petrol engine counterparts, but the latter produce fewer toxic emissions.

            <p>
                Under-inflated tyres create more rolling resistance, which uses more fuel. Check the tyre pressure regularly and adjust it if necessary. Have your old tyres replaced with energy saving ones where possible and arrange for the wheel alignment to be looked at, as your car will be more energy-efficient if it is correctly set.

            <p>
                A little TLC will go a long way to keeping your car in good condition and running at its most efficient. Make sure you have it serviced regularly, keep the engine correctly tuned, check that the fuel and ignition systems are operating as they should, when you change your oil use the correct grade recommended for your car, and keep your air filter clean.

                Extra weight equals extra fuel consumption, so, before you set off, remove any heavy items from the boot and don&rsquo;t travel with an empty roof rack. Drive off as soon as possible when you start your engine up &ndash; don&rsquo;t pump out more CO2 than is necessary. Avoiding harsh braking and heavy use of the accelerator. If you&rsquo;re at a standstill for more than three minutes turn the engine off.

            <p>
                Before you set off, ask yourself if you really need to drive. If it&rsquo;s only a short trip, walk or cycle instead, especially in the summer. Why not arrange to car share on longer journeys, you&rsquo;ll save money and fuel so you&rsquo;ll be doing your bit for the environment and your pocket!

                Knocking down walls
            </h1>
            <p>
                Most home improvements are cosmetic and/or functional and need only a rudimentary knowledge of DIY and how a house works. But if you wish to knock through two reception rooms to make a large one, or rearrange the rooms in your house, then a different level of competence is required as these are structural changes.</p>

                <p>Removal of walls, to open up or add on rooms, is a skilled job and can require specific heavy duty equipment. While you can attempt to ‘do it yourself’, the best advice is to get the experts in – an engineer or architect to survey, and a reputable builder. Either way, it’s helpful to know the building process required and any knock-on effects the work can have.

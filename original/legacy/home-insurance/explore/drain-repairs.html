                You know pretty quickly if your drain gets blocked. The toilet won't flush and grates overflow. Of course you'll want to get it fixed right away, but don't pay for expensive repairs if you don't have to. Changes to the law mean you're only responsible for your own drains.

            <h2>What's changed?</h2>
            <p>
                For years, homeowners were legally required to maintain shared so-called 'private' sewers within their property - as well as some drains outside the property boundaries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                That's no longer the case. As of October 2011, water and sewerage companies are responsible for these repairs. Don't expect the water companies to shout about it though.
            </p>

                Whatever anyone tells you, you're only responsible for your own drains - the ones used just by your home. Even if your drain meets a neighbour's, you're only responsible for your part of the drain.

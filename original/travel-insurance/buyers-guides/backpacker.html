                Taking time out after school or college to travel is a popular option among students, while people already working are increasingly taking a career break to do temporary casual work abroad or simply to travel. Whichever group you are in, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you won&rsquo;t be caught out financially in a foreign country &ndash; and find yourself facing a lot of unexpected costs. This is where Direct Line can help&hellip;

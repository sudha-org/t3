				<p>The mass exodus that takes place every summer and bank holiday is a sign that families are taking more holidays abroad than ever. According to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), 2.3 million people went abroad on Easter Weekend 2006, with a similar 2.1 million heading off on the very first weekend of the summer holidays.</p>
				<p>Of course, every parent wants to make sure that neither they, nor their children, encounter any difficulties while they are away. But if something should happen, having the right <a href="/travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> for your family can provide invaluable peace of mind.</p>
				<p>For families who are travelling abroad, Direct Line can offer <a href="/travel-insurance/options#annual-multi-trip">annual family travel insurance</a>. This can cover your family’s possessions in case they are lost or stolen. Perhaps more importantly, you are all covered in the event of an accident, should you need medical assistance. Many parents appreciate this so they can focus on their family rather than worry about medical costs.</p>
				<p>You and your family are also automatically covered for organised activities such as snorkelling, beach games and swimming. Should you be going skiing, you can take out <a href="/travel-insurance/buyers-guides/skiing-holiday">winter sports</a> travel cover with the payment of an additional premium.</p>
				<p>What’s more, this policy covers adults travelling independently without their children, but also covers children travelling without the policyholder such as going on supervised school trips.</p>
				<p>And because this is an <a href="/travel-insurance/options#annual-multi-trip">annual travel insurance policy</a> it means that you are covered for any number of trips up to 42 days each, up to a total of 120 days in the year.</p>
				<p>You can get an <a target="_blank" href="http://css.directline.com/insurance/travel/startaction.do?entrypoint=0001&amp;productline=0005">annual travel insurance quote</a> online in minutes and if you buy online, you will receive an extra discount</p>

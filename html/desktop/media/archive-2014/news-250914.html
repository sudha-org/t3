                New research <sup>1</sup> from Direct Line reveals that an improved financial situation and good health are the top hopes for Brits in the coming six months.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Direct Line &lsquo;Hopes and Fears&rsquo; Index, which tracks the nation&rsquo;s aspirations and concerns over a six month period, found that as summer comes to a close better weather has been replaced as the top hope by improved money and good health (both cited by 43 per cent of respondents).
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the study, four of the top five aspirations are non-financially focused, two in five Brits (40 per cent) are hoping for a holiday as autumn approaches while more than a third (36 per cent) are hoping to lose weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fear of terrorist attack has risen most markedly in the rankings, from fourteenth six months ago to rank as the fifth greatest fear of Brits for the next six months. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Brits ranked this as one of their primary concerns. This could be seen as a reflection of public perception of the recent terror activity, hoaxes and the UK&rsquo;s heightened alert status.

                        The nation&rsquo;s greatest fear for the immediate future is their health and the health of loved ones, with 46 per cent citing this as one of their main concerns. The majority of concerns are financially motivated with three of the top five fears centred on money and their standard of living. Over a quarter (27 per cent) of people are concerned about making ends meet, while 26 per cent are worried about inflation and a further 26 per cent fear a drop in their standard of living.

                        <em>
                            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how much the index has altered in the past six months. However, the survey shows that ill health still tops the fear index. After all, no matter how much money you have, if you have poor health - or someone close to you is ill &ndash; your blooming bank balance is of little consolation. But what does seem highly significant to me is that seven of the top ten fears are about money and employment, which would suggest that the upward trend in the country&rsquo;s economy has &ndash; so far &ndash; not resulted in a sense of solvency or security for the average person.

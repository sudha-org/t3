            <h2>9<sup>th</sup> October 2013</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly two thirds of parents would encourage their child to purchase telematics insurance</li>
                <li>Almost three in four believe telematics makes young people drive more responsibly</li>
                <li>Just under half believe telematics should be compulsory for all drivers under 25</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Parents with children aged 16- 26 are set to increase demand for telematics, as nearly two thirds (62 per cent) admit they would encourage their child to buy a telematics-based insurance policy, according to research* by DrivePlus from Direct Line car insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research highlighted that the majority of parents of young drivers view telematics as positive for both their child&rsquo;s pocket and safety. Three quarters (75 per cent) of mums and dads believe telematics is a good way to bring down the cost of car insurance and 73 per cent feel it reduces the dangers of driving for young people, by rewarding them to drive more responsibly. Nearly half of parents (46 per cent) would actually like to see telematics become compulsory for drivers under 25.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parents not only want their children to embrace this technology, but over four out of ten (43 per cent) want to view their child&rsquo;s driving behaviour online. Primarily they want access to check their loved one is driving safely. Eighty seven per cent of parents who want to view their child&rsquo;s driving behaviour would like to see whether their child is speeding, 74 per cent want to check their child&rsquo;s average speed and 51 and 41 per cent want to monitor their child&rsquo;s braking and cornering respectively.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Paul Felton, Head of Telematics at Direct Line, said: </strong>
                <em>&ldquo;Parents are obviously concerned about their child&rsquo;s safety and will always have mixed emotions when they start to drive. While driving gives a young person freedom, it also brings them closer to the potential dangers that are only too real on our roads. Parents seem to be embracing telematics as they see it as a great way to encourage less aggressive driving behaviours combined with lower car insurance premiums.&rdquo;</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The research also revealed that views differed between the sexes with fathers seeming more positive towards the benefits telematics can bring. Sixty five per cent of fathers would be more likely to encourage their child to purchase a telematics-based insurance policy, compared with 59 per cent of mothers. More fathers (74 per cent) believe telematics can help young people drive more responsibly, while 72 per cent of mothers thought the same.

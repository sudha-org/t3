                Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent may have finished for another year, but pet insurer Direct Line wants to find out if the dog&rsquo;s got talent? Or perhaps the cat can do the can-can? According to research from Direct Line <a href="/pet-insurance">Pet Insurance</a>*, 86 per cent of dog owners think their dog has got talent. In fact, one in five dog owners think their canine friends can dance.

                <strong>Edd Barclay (pronounced Bark-lee), Direct Line pet product manager, comments:</strong> <em>&ldquo;We are looking for the nation&rsquo;s disco dogs and tap dancing tabby cats to feature in our TV adverts on the Animal Planet Channel. We have been helping people protect their pets by insuring dogs and cats for over 15 years, and now is the chance for the pets to take the spotlight - whatever their moggy or mutt moves are.&rdquo;</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The research commissioned by Direct Line and K9 Media revealed that 15 per cent of dog owners think their pooch can sing and 69 per cent of respondents admitted they thought their pet was more talented than most humans.

                <strong>Pet insurance expert, Edd Barclay continues:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Budding pet idols will have a dance off to the music from the Direct Line adverts and the 15 pets with the most votes will star in Direct Line&rsquo;s next wave of TV adverts on Animal Planet channel in October.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>&ldquo;The video with the most overall votes will win a family holiday for four to Hollywood. The more votes received the more prizes on offer. The public don&rsquo;t have to own a pet to get involved. Everyone can still vote for their favourite dancing dog or cat and win great prizes.&rdquo;</em>

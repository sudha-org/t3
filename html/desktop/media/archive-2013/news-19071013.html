            <h2>19<sup>th</sup> July 2013</h2>
            <p>
                From this week Direct Line <a href="/car-insurance">car insurance</a> customers will be able to choose to have a replacement car sourced on their behalf rather than a cash settlement in the event of their car being written-off after an accident or accidental damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study of 1,212 car buyers found that the average motorist takes a month to find a new car*, while the new replacement car service can significantly reduce the amount of time, and especially the stress, involved in finding a new car for customers once their vehicle has been agreed as a write-off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many car buyers spend time going to dealerships (44 per cent), doing online research (52 per cent), reading car reviews (33 per cent), searching local used car listings (19 per cent) and taking test drives (29 per cent) as part of their research under usual circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct Line has partnered with a network of trusted car dealerships including Lookers, Arnold Clark, Vospers, Stoneacre and Marshalls to help take the stress out of searching for a replacement car after their vehicle has been written-off.
            </p>
            <p>
                All customers who are looking to buy a replacement vehicle worth &pound;3,500 or more can use the service if their car is written-off after an accident. Customers can brief the dealerships to source a replacement car to similar specifications as their original car or to contribute additional funds to upgrade to a car of higher value. All cars sourced through Direct Line&rsquo;s network of garages come complete with a warranty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dealerships aim to source a new car within five days, although the customer can opt to revert to a cash settlement at any point.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>David Mills, head of Motor Fulfilment at Direct Line, said:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Searching for a replacement car takes considerable time and energy, even when you&rsquo;re in the market for a new vehicle. Our new partnership with car dealerships helps take some of this stress away from customers, especially at a time when they are likely to already feel under strain from being without their own car.&rdquo;</em>

            <h2>Weather update:</h2>

            <p>Bad weather has hit the UK hard and we’re currently receiving high call volumes from customers everywhere. During this time we're doing our very best to answer all of them and progress claims as quickly as possible, but you may face a long waiting time. To help you stay safe, we’ve put together some helpful flood and storm damage tips - so you’ll know what to do.</p>

            <h2>What to do if…</h2>

            <h3>...your property has been flooded:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact our 24-hour emergency helpline on 0845 601 3004 as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>You might be eligible for alternative alternative accommodation. The cost is may be covered under your insurance policy - you can check when speaking to the Claims team.</li>
                <li>Keep records. Take photographs or film the damage to your building and its contents. This may help with the settlement of your claim.</li>
                <li>Don't throw away possessions without first discussing it with your Claims Adviser. The items will need to be assessed.</li>
                <li>Stay safe. Do not use electrical equipment or the gas supply until it has been checked by a qualified tradesman.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>...your property is at risk of flooding:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be prepared. Think of an evacuation plan for your family, so that no one gets injured and you have more time to save valuable items.</li>
                <li>Only if it’s safe to do so, check to ensure any drains and gutters are clear of debris so rainfall can drain from your property effectively – do not put anyone at risk of injury by carrying out these checks.</li>
                <li>Place valuable and electrical items in high cupboards or take them upstairs to reduce the impact of any flood damage.</li>
                <li>Ensure outdoor furniture and other items likely to float away are safely restrained to reduce the risk of these items causing secondary damage or being lost.</li>
                <li>Stay informed. If it’s safe to use electrical equipment, make sure you get the latest weather and flood updates from your local TV and radio services.</li>
                <li>Keep important documents safe in a waterproof bag. This includes your insurance policy details and useful contact numbers.</li>
                <li>Make a list of must-have numbers - your insurer, your local council, the emergency services and the number of Floodline: 0845 988 1188.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>...your property has been damaged by storm:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Get in touch with us quickly. Direct Line will usually pay for all emergency repairs you need to stop the damage getting worse.</li>
                <li>Take pictures of the damage. It may help with the settlement of your claim.</li>
                <li>Keep safe. Use tarpaulin to temporarily repair storm-damaged roofs only if it’s absolutely safe to do so.</li>
                <li>Keep your garage and shed doors closed and locked when not in use. This will not only prevent the wind blowing them off the hinges, it will also keep your property secure from opportunist burglars.</li>
                <li>Always check with the Claims team. Under Buildings insurance, storm damage generally excludes damage to gates, fences and some policies will also exclude hedges. Walls that have fence panels inserted are usually covered, though the fence panel itself would still be excluded.</li>

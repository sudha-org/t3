			<p>Life insurance is an affordable way to help financial security for your loved ones if you die during the length of the policy. What’s more, a good life insurance policy will help them deal with the everyday financial worries such as bills, childcare and college costs, as well as mortgage payments.</p>

			<p>We understand that most people don’t like to think about life insurance because it means they think about the inevitable. However, it’s also because most of us find it quite complicated and don’t know what cover to choose.</p>

			<p>The key here is to identify what you want life insurance cover for, because that will help determine the best life insurance policy for you – level term assurance or mortgage decreasing term assurance, for example. Remember that you have to do a bit of research before you take out a policy – it has to be one that best suits your needs. Our life insurance calculator might help you find out. </p>

			<h1>What <strong class="red">types</strong> of life insurance are there?</h1>
			<p>There are different types available to suit different needs:</p>
			<ul class="coloured-list red-circle outside">
				<li><a href="/life-insurance/options/level-protection"><span class="red">Level Term Assurance</span></a> helps protect your family financially if you die during the term. The benefit amount remains fixed throughout the length of the policy – unless you decide to change your policy.  </li>
				<br>
				<li><a href="/life-insurance/options/mortgage-decreasing-term-assurance"><span class="red">Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance</span></a> is specifically designed to help pay off a capital and interest mortgage. This way if you die during the term of your policy, your mortgage can be repaid and your loved ones may not have to move home or struggle to make ends meet after you’re gone - depending on the amount of cover taken. </li> 
				<br>
				<li><a href="/life-insurance/options#life-over50s-insurance"><span class="red">Over 50s Life Insurance</span></a> is designed for people aged 50 to 80. With this cover you can help contribute towards your funeral costs or you can use the money paid as a gift for your grandchildren. </li>
				<br>
				<li class="no-bullet">Most life insurance providers also offer the option to add <a href="/life-insurance/options/critical-illness">Critical Illness Cover</a> for an extra cost when you buy a policy. It's designed to pay out if you're diagnosed with a critical illness and can’t work to support your family.</li>

            <p>If you’ve changed your mind about a holiday or you can’t go away because of an emergency, you’ll need to cancel your holiday booking. Your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract. You’ll also need to check the terms and conditions of your <a href="/travel-insurance" title="travel insurance">travel insurance</a> to see if your circumstances are covered.</p>
            <p>Even more stressful is if you’ve already left for your holiday and you get a phone call to say that something happened, and you have to get home as soon as possible. While it may not be a priority at the time, it’s worth knowing that you may be able to make a claim should this happen to you.</p>

                <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
                <p>The first thing to do is to go to the holiday company you bought your holiday from. Many have a cancellation policy, especially if they’re ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents) members. If you cancel before you’re due to go, you may get a refund of the amount you’ve paid – this tends to be on a sliding scale, with the refund being less the nearer you get to departure. </p>
                <p>However, there are still many holiday companies that don’t provide compensation if you have to return home for personal reasons. If your agreement doesn't allow for cancellation you may have to cover the loss made by the holiday company because of your cancellation. If this happens you should consider making a claim on your travel insurance.</p>

                <h2>What you can claim for</h2>
                <p>If you need to make a claim because you've cancelled or shortened your trip, your insurer will only accept your claim if you have a good reason for doing this.</p> 
                <p>Reasons may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unexpected death, illness or injury of you, your partner or people travelling with you</li>
                    <li>A fire, burglary or unexpected damage happens to your home</li>
                    <li>You're made redundant</li>
                    <li>You're pregnant and are advised not to travel for a medical reason that occurred after you took out the insurance</li>
                    <li>You're called for jury service or as a witness in court</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have to come home early, your insurer will usually only refund any extra travelling costs and the cost of any unused time in your holiday accommodation. </p>

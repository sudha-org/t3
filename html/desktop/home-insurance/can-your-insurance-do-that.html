            <h2>Things to remember</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mobile phone claims: contact your network provider to ensure your phone is blocked. We can't replace your mobile phone until you've done this and the 8 hours won't apply.</li>
                <li>The link does not work on Blackberrys and Windows operated devices.</li>
                <li>The 8 hour claim assessment could be affected if we're experiencing extreme weather conditions. If this happens, our claims handlers will deal with our most urgent claims.</li>
            </ol>
 
            <p>Applies to theft claims and accidental loss up to ยฃ3,000. Cover limits apply. For mobile phone claims we may need to check the phone has been stopped with your network provider which can take up to 24 hours. If we need more information about your claim, we'll contact you and ask for more photos and descriptions. We may send one of our assessors to visit you if we can't fully assess your claim from the proof you've provided. We reserve the right to investigate where fraud is suspected and the 8 hours will not apply.</p>

            <h2>Choose where and when</h2>

            <p>We try to be as flexibile as possible for when you need us the most. That's why we'll work around your schedule once you make your claim.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>

            <p>Our product specialists will call you so that we can arrange the delivery of your items. We'll be as flexible as possible so you get your items when and where you want them.</p>

                <li>Named day - Monday to Friday</li>
                <li>Address of your choice</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Choose between cash or new replacement</h2>

            <p>If your essential household items are stolen or damaged beyond repair, we'll give you the choice of cash or a brand new replacement. Because we think you're the best person to decide.</p>

We (U K Insurance Limited) can change these terms and conditions at any time without notice and without incurring liability.</p>

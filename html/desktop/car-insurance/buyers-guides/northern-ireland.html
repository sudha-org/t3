                Did you know that you could benefit from Direct Line car insurance in Northern Ireland too? Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct Line provides cover for cars across the UK including England, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland. To qualify for our car insurance your car must be registered at a UK address and customers in Northern Ireland must be over
                the age of 22 years. For all customers who qualify for our car insurance we can provide three types of cover: comprehensive, third party fire &amp; theft, and third party only. As a Northern Ireland resident you could also benefit from
                our optional extras such as guaranteed hire car and motor legal protection. Please call us if you would like a quote for third party only car insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that&rsquo;s not all &ndash; with Direct Line the good deal gets even better! Not only do we provide cover for personal motor use, we can also give you cover if you use your car for business purposes &ndash; for example if you work from home in Northern Ireland and
                need to visit clients up and down the country or in the rest of the UK, or you need your motor to make deliveries. There are some exclusions depending on individual circumstances &ndash; we won&rsquo;t cover you if you leave your car in an area to
                which aircraft have access, if you are a taxi driver, or have a pick-up truck. It is important to note that a vehicle used for business is not the same as a company car: the company that owns or leases a car to you should arrange the insurance,
                as fleet insurance, and Direct Line does not offer this kind of car insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                As government reports show that uninsured driving is also a problem in Northern Ireland, you can also gain more peace of mind on the road thanks to our uninsured driver promise. This means that if you make a claim for an accident with an uninsured driver,
                providing it was not your fault, your no claims discount will not be affected (every year you don&rsquo;t make a claim we give you more no claims discount up to five years) and we&rsquo;ll cover your excess. This promise is for comprehensive policyholders
                only.
            </p>

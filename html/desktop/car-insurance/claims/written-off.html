            <p>
                If your car is damaged, it may be more expensive to repair your car than to replace it. In insurance-speak, this would be called a 'Total Loss'. In these cases, we need to put a settlement value on your car.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your car is less than one year old and you are the first and only registered owner, in order to get you back on the road as quickly as possible with the minimum amount of hassle, we will try to offer you a permanent replacement vehicle of the same
                make and model. If we can't, your claim will be settled based on the market value of your car when the accident happened, less any excess that may apply.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your car is more than one year old and is written off, instead of just being offered a cheque for the settlement value of your car, less any excess that may apply, we can find you a replacement car if you would like using our trusted nationwide network.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can upgrade the new car by adding your own money. Or you can downgrade, and take the extra value as cash. It's your choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                This service excludes theft claims and the minimum price of the replacement car is &pound;3500. It is also subject to availability &ndash; we may not be able to find an exact match for your car.

            <h1 class="h1-margin">DrivePlus:<br />Our black box car insurance</h1>

            <p>Drivers under 21 can get a 25% upfront discount, while drivers aged 21-25 can get at least a 15% upfront discount. Drivers 26 and over may also receive a discount, but if your premium is under £600 you may pay extra in your first year's premium to receive the DrivePlus Plug-in. The DrivePlus Plug-in is only available for cars manufactured later than 2002.</p>

            <p>We use telematics technology – also known as black box technology - to understand how you drive. But wait – that’s not all. With the DrivePlus Plug-in you can also find out what you do – and don’t do – when you’re behind the wheel. This way we can offer you car insurance premiums based on how you drive.</p>

            <p>How does it work?</p>

            <ol>
            <li>When you take out a car insurance policy with Direct Line, you’ll be asked to opt-in to a DrivePlus Telematics policy and enter the code DRIVEPLUS. <br /><br />

            Using the code, if you’re a young driver under 21 you can get a 25% upfront discount that will be applied to your quote. If you are aged 21-25 you can get at least a 15% upfront discount that will be applied to your quote. Drivers 26 and over may also receive a discount, but if your premium is under £500 you may pay extra in your first year's premium to receive the DrivePlus Plug-in.<br /><br />

            Once you've bought your cover, we'll post your plug-in to you.</li><br />

            <li>Got your DrivePlus Plug-in? Time to fit it to your car. We’ll take you through the process with our step-by-step guide. This is very easy and takes less than a minute – no tools required.</li>

            <li>The device sends feedback on how you drive. We’ll use this information to analyse your driving behaviour for things like smooth driving, acceleration, and braking.</li>
            <li>If you drive safely and get a high driving score you’ll be rewarded with a discount on renewal. To find out more, visit our <a href="/car-insurance/telematics" title="DrivePlus Portal">DrivePlus Portal</a>.</li>
            </ol>

                <strong>What is telematics technology and how does it work?</strong><br>
                Telematics technology &ndash; best known as black box technology&ndash; is a great way for drivers and insurers to get information on driving behaviour and style in real time. It works by fitting wireless devices and &lsquo;black boxes&rsquo; to your car and analysing the data transmitted to us. This way we can offer you car insurance premiums based on how safe you drive.<br>

                <strong>Who does Direct Line Group work with?</strong><br>
                DLG works with suppliers - these are companies that provide and/or install telematics devices. Our scheme suppliers collect and transmit data to us when telematics devices are switched on and analyse that data on our behalf.<br>

                <strong>What happens if I break the speed limit?</strong><br>
                We strongly advise all drivers to obey the Highway Code and drive in accordance with the law but the data we collect will not be used to influence the cover that we provide to you under your existing insurance.<br>

                <ul>

                <strong>How much will the app cost?</strong><br>
                The app is free to download and use, and is available on App Store and Google Play Store.<br>

                <a class="anchor" name="driveplusapp4"></a>
                <strong>How much data will the app need?</strong><br>
                For a typical day&rsquo;s commute of 1 hour each way to work at 28mph, roughly 4.2MB of data will be used which is the size of an average digital photo. Costs will vary by network, but will typically be covered by many contracts.<br>

                <a class="anchor" name="driveplusapp5"></a>
                <strong>How often does the app send data?</strong><br>
                The app will send data throughout your journeys. If it can&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;ll save and send the trip data next time you have network coverage. If you would like data transmission restrictions, they can be applied in Preferences &ndash; just click Preferences to alter.<br>

                <strong>How much memory is required to save my driving data?</strong><br>
                Typical journey data uses less space than a digital photo and is deleted after transmission.<br>

                <strong>What data are you going to collect?</strong> <br>
                Once the app is activated, data will be sent from your car to analyse your driving style - this includes, braking, accelerating, cornering, location, distance and route travelled - by using GPS technology. This information will be used to build up a profile of how, where and when your vehicle is driven.<br>

                Only U K Insurance Ltd and The Floow, the provider of the app, will have access to your driving information. We will never release your data outside these parties.<br>

                <strong>What does my DrivePlus score mean?</strong><br>
                The score is representative of how you drive. A higher score indicates that you are a good driver and vice versa.<br>

                    <strong>How can I redeem my discount?</strong><br>
                    If you're not a Direct Line policy holder yet and you've completed the 200 miles you may be eligible for a discount on your quoted premium. You will then receive a discount code on your app. This can be redeemed by one of the following methods:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Click on &lsquo;email me the code&rsquo; on the app and a code will be sent to the email address you provided at registration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Via the Direct Line quote website: <a href="/">www.directline.com.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Via phone, if you call 0845 246 0124.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you're a current Direct Line policy holder and you've completed 2000 miles 8 -12 weeks before your policy renewal date you may be eligible for a discount on your next quoted renewal premium, which will be automatically deducted. You will receive a confirmation email after completion of the minimum mileage.<br>

                <strong>How long is my discount code valid for?</strong><br>
                If you're not a Direct Line policy holder your discount code may be removed if you don&rsquo;t redeem it within 30 days of receipt.
                If you're an existing Direct Line policy holder then you must tick that you are an &lsquo;existing customer&rsquo; during app registration. We will use your car registration, date of birth and postcode to find your policy and apply your discount. If we cannot find your policy we will email you.<br>

                <strong>Could my premium go up at renewal if I get a bad score?</strong><br>
                We will consider your score at renewal, which may decrease or increase your premium depending on how well you drive. However, you will have the option to remain on your existing product without DrivePlus.<br>

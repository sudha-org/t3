                        <p>Named drivers on your Direct Line car insurance policy will earn a <a class="text-link" tabindex="3510" href="/car-insurance/discounts/named-driver-no-claims" target="" title="Named Driver No Claim Discount">Named Driver No Claim Discount</a> in their own name for every continuous claim free policy year, up to a maximum of 5 years. This can be used when they take out their own car insurance policy with Direct Line.</p>
                        <h3>Here's how it works:</h3>
                        <p>'Mark' has insured his son 'Phil' as a named driver on his Direct Line policy for the last three years. Phil buys his own car and wants to take out his own policy with Direct Line. He's been claim free for the last three years on his dad's policy, so is entitled to a discount on his new policy with Direct Line. This is his Named Driver No Claim Discount. At the end of his first year as a policyholder himself he has still not made a claim, so when Phil comes to renew, he'll receive a discount for the three years he was a Named Driver with no claims plus a No Claim Discount for being claim free for one year as a policy holder.</p>
                        <p>The Named Driver Discount earned will be applied on renewal every year he remains claim free on his Direct Line main policy. If Phil chooses another insurer at this time he'll be able to take his one year earned No Claim Discount with him, however other insurers may not accept the Named Driver No Claim Discount he has earned.</p>
                        <p>Other points to consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If Phil's dad Mark leaves Direct Line, Phil has to buy a policy within 90 days to benefit from his earned Named Driver No Claims Discount.</li>
                            <li>If Phil makes a claim whilst he is a Named Driver on Mark's policy, he may lose all or part of his Named Driver No Claim Discount.</li>
                            <li>If Phil, the Named Driver, makes a claim on the policy, his Named Driver No Claim Discount will be reduced by two years for each fault claim.</li>
                            <li>The Named Driver No Claim Discount may be lower than the No Claim Discount of the main policyholder.</li>
                            <li>Named Driver No Claim Discount may not be recognised by other insurers.</li>
                            <li>Named Driver No Claim Discount works differently in that it's applied as a discount to policies held with us and although this discount continues to be added at each renewal along with No Claim Discount, no actual years will be shown on the policy documents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Taking advantage of this is easy. If you are a Named Driver on a Direct Line car insurance policy and would like to take out your own policy and benefit from this discount, simply call us on 0845 246 0311.</strong></p>
                        <p>To identify the policy on which Named Drivers have earned this discount, we'll ask for the main policyholder's:</p>
                        <p>Name <br />Date of birth <br />Postcode <br />Policy number <br />Vehicle registration</p>

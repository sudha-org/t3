            <h2>Benefits of our multi-car discount</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>You'll get a discount for every additional car you insure with us</strong>
                    <br />Save money every time you add another vehicle. And anyone living in the same home is eligible for a discount on their vehicles too. Subject to minimum premium. Introductory discount.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your No Claim Discount will not be affected by other drivers on a policy</strong>
                    <br />If one of you has an accident or makes a claim, the others won't lose their No Claim Discounts.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Every car you insure can keep its own renewal date</strong>
                    <br />Each policy can keep its current start date, so there's no need to worry about the expense of policies all renewing at the same time.</li>

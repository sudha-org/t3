                        <p>To use this service, you'll need to use one of our approved repairers. We have a nationwide network of approved repairers, all of which carry a British Standard Kitemark. All of our approved repairers work to the highest industry standards and all repairs are guaranteed for 5 years.</p> 

                        <p>After your car's been picked up or dropped off at the repairer, they'll log it onto their system. When this is done, you'll receive a text (SMS). This is the start of your 7 days.</p> 

                        <p>Your car will be inspected and any parts will be ordered. You might have already been asked to send in photos or videos of the damage, and if so, your parts might have been ordered already.</p> 

                        <p>The repairer will let you know when they think your car should be ready.</p> 

                        <p>You can keep up-to-date with the progress of your repair by logging into our repair tracker.</p>

                        <p>When the repair is complete you'll receive a text with the time and date. This is the end of your 7 days.</p>

                        <p>The repairer will then arrange an ideal time to return your car or for you to pick it up if that’s more convenient.</p>

                        <p>Once it's agreed that repairs can start on your car and it's arrived on-site, it will be logged on to the repairer's system. This will be confirmed to you by text and this is when the 7 day clock starts.</p> 

                        <p>The repair time ends when your repairs have been completed. The repairer will send you a text with the date and time the repairs are completed.</p>

                        <p>We aim to repair all cars in 7 days, but we know that some repairs will take longer depending on the type of damage.  We will never compromise on safety in order to achieve the 7 day repair time and all our repairs will meet manufacturers specifications and come with a 5 year guarantee. Sometimes there might be delays in getting particular parts which could also cause delays to the repair.</p>  

                        <p>Whatever the reason, if we haven't managed to repair your car in 7 days, from day 8 we'll give you &pound;10 for each day we're over, up to a maximum of &pound;70. So even if your repair takes 1 minute longer than 7 days, you’ll be eligible for a payment.</p> 

                        <p>If this happens the repairer will keep you informed. You won't have to do anything we'll handle everything. More often than not we'll be able to pay the money straight into the policyholder’s bank account and we'll aim to do that within a week of the repairs being complete. If for some reason we can't do this, don't worry we'll send a cheque instead – this could take a little longer to receive in the post.  If you haven't received your payment within 4 weeks, please contact our claims team and we'll investigate for you.</p>

You can also use our online repair tracker to keep up to date and find the contact details for your repairer. You will be sent a text (SMS) with your log on details and your unique passcode.

                        <p>No - if the repairer thinks it will help them assess the damage to your car and speed up the repair (for example, they might be able to order the relevant parts before your car comes in), they'll ask you if you're happy to send them photos or a video. Don't worry if you don't want to do this, that’s not a problem, you will still be able to use the 7 day repair.</p>  

                        <p>If you're happy to send photos, the repairer will send you a link via text or email. All you need to do is click on this link and it'll take you through what you need to do – you can add a video as well as photos.  Once you've sent these you'll see a note to say that the information has been submitted. Your repairer will then be able to look at the images and assess the damage to your car.  Your repairer might have already arranged a suitable date with you for your car repairs to start. If not, they'll be in contact within 2 working days of receiving your photos to arrange a date with you. The repairer will always do a full inspection of the car when it arrives on site in case there’s any other damage that can't be seen from the photos.</p>

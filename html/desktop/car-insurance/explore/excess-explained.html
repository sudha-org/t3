            <p>
                Did you know that increasing your voluntary excess payments could reduce the premium on your Car Insurance? For a good deal better from Direct Line, it&rsquo;s worth getting clued up about&hellip;
            </p>
            <h2>What is excess?</h2>
            <p>
                Excess is an amount of money you usually have to pay when you make a claim on most kinds of insurance &ndash; Direct Line Car Insurance, Home Insurance and Travel Insurance, for example. The amount you pay is agreed when you take your policy out.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Direct Line Car Insurance, you only pay the excess amount when you make a claim under our Comprehensive and Third Party Fire and Theft Car Insurance policies. Excess does not apply to Third Party Only.
            </p>
            <h2>How much excess do I pay?</h2>
            <p>
                The amount of excess you pay depends on a number of factors, including what type of car you have and who will be driving it. This figure is made clear when you apply for a quote and receive your personal policy documents.
            </p>
            <h2>Who do I pay my excess to?</h2>
            <p>
                If you make a claim and your car needs repairing under the terms of your policy, the agreed excess should be paid direct to the approved repair garage.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your car is written off, the excess will be deducted from any settlement payment you confirm with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your car was damaged in an accident that was another driver&rsquo;s fault &ndash; and is accepted by the third party&rsquo;s insurer &ndash; you should be able to reclaim your excess payment back from them.
            </p>
            <h2>A good deal better with Direct Line</h2>
            <p>
                With Direct Line <a href="/car-insurance/options/comprehensive">Comprehensive Car Insurance</a>, you also get the benefit of our &lsquo;Uninsured Driver Promise&rsquo;: If you claim for an accident that is not your fault and the driver of the car that hits you is not insured, you won&rsquo;t have to pay any excess (or if you do, it will be refunded as soon as &lsquo;no fault&rsquo; is declared).

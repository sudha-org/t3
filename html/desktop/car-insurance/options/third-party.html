            <p>The minimum cover offered by Direct Line car insurance is third party only car insurance. But you’ll find third party only insurance is just one of three levels of cover we offer.</p>

            <p>Third party only insurance from Direct Line is the lowest and therefore may be the cheapest level of cover in our car insurance range. It covers your liabilities against third parties – for instance if you have an accident that is your fault and you damage someone else’s car, property or person.</p>

            <p>All our <a href="/car-insurance" title="car insurance">car insurance</a> policies include third party car insurance. With third party fire and theft, you also benefit from cover in case your vehicle is damaged by fire or if someone attempts to break in or steal it. With <a href="comprehensive" title="comprehensive car insurance">comprehensive car insurance</a> you get the most cover – and therefore the greatest peace of mind. It includes all of the above plus cover for personal accident and injury, medical expenses and windscreen replacement and repair in the event of breakage. With comprehensive cover there is no excess to pay if you’re hit by an uninsured driver with our exclusive Uninsured Driver Promise.</p>

            <p>If you want to drive abroad, you may need a Green Card, which will provide the minimum amount of cover required for the country you are driving in. The minimum cover required for other countries could be less than the cover offered by Direct Line whilst driving in the UK. Not all countries are covered under a Green Card so please call us for more information. If you would like to extend your level of cover when travelling abroad, again please call us.</p>

            <p>Our customers also have the opportunity to purchase a number of car insurance extras. These include guaranteed hire car (for comprehensive policy holders) and motor legal protection, which can help drivers to claim for uninsured losses. Other additional discounts and benefits, including <a href="/car-insurance/discounts#multi-car" title="multi-car discount">multi-car discount</a>, named driver no claims discount and matched driver discount are only available for comprehensive car insurance policyholders.</p>

            <p>To find out more about our range of car insurance, including third party only cover, click on our types of car insurance or, for more detailed information, download our <a href="/car-insurance/policy-documents" title="car insurance policy">car insurance policy</a> documents online.</p>

            <p>Remember, it is illegal to drive in the UK if you do not have adequate car insurance. Make sure you have at least the minimum required cover.</p>

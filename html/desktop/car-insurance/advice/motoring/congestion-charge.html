                customers who are London drivers will probably be more than familiar with the Congestion Charge. If your memory needs to be refreshed or you are a regional
                driver thinking of driving into the capital, then don&rsquo;t set off without reading our introductory guide&hellip;
            </p>
            <h2>What is the Congestion Charge?</h2>
            <p>
                Introduced in February 2003, the Congestion Charge is designed to alleviate traffic gridlock in London and to help raise funds for public transport improvements in the capital. Payment of the Congestion Charge &ndash; &pound;8 if you pay by midnight on the
                day of travel or &pound;10 if you &lsquo;pay next day&rsquo;, by midnight the following charging day &ndash; allows you to enter, drive within and exit the Congestion Charging Zone as many times as you wish on that day. The Congestion Charge applies to weekdays only
                &ndash; Saturdays and Sundays are exempt. This means that, if you enter the zone on a Friday, you have until midnight on Monday to &lsquo;pay next day&rsquo;, albeit through the call centre or website only. Weekends, bank holidays and the three days between
                Christmas and New Year are also non-charging days.
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                Basically, cameras read your vehicle registration mark as you enter, drive within or exit the Congestion Charging Zone. They then check it against the database and, if you have not paid, you will be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) and
                fined &pound;100. If you pay this within 14 days, the fine is reduced to &pound;50. If you fail to pay it within 28 days, the penalty is increased to &pound;150. Failure to pay this can lead to action being taken by the County Court. If you have paid your Congestion
                Charge, or your vehicle is exempt from charges or 100% discounted, the record of your vehicle will be automatically wiped from the database.
            </p>
            <h2>Where do I pay my Congestion Charge?</h2>
            <p>
                You can pay at selected shops, petrol stations and car parks, by post &ndash; using a downloaded form from the website &ndash; by telephone, by SMS text message from your mobile phone and at BT Internet kiosks.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is exempt from or discounted under the Congestion Charge?</h2>
            <p>
                Not all drivers have to pay the Congestion Charge. Exemptions, discounts and possible refunds apply to:

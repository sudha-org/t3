                <h2>Why vaccinate?</h2>

                <p>As a pet owner, you’re responsible for your animal’s welfare. Vaccinations are a vital part of this. They protect your pet against a range of common diseases that may be life threatening and expensive to cure.</p>

                <p>In fact, <a href="/pet-insurance" target="" title="">pet insurance</a> won’t usually cover you for the treatment of diseases that could have been vaccinated against.</p>



                <div class="small-spaced-wrapper"></div>
                <h2>Dog vaccinations</h2>

                <p>Your vet will recommend the correct vaccinations for your dog. These could include vaccinating against:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list-green">
                    <li><p>Canine Distemper, a serious viral disease</p></li>
                    <li><p>Hepatitis</p></li>
                    <li><p>Parvovirus, which is often fatal to dogs</p></li>
                    <li><p>Leptospirosis, which often causes life-threatening liver and kidney damage</p></li>
                    <li><p>Kennel cough</p></li>
                </ul>

                <div class="small-spaced-wrapper"></div>
                <h2>When should you vaccinate your dog?</h2>
                <p>Puppies can get their first vaccination course from approximately eight weeks old. They shouldn’t come into contact with other dogs until they are fully vaccinated.</p>

                <div class="small-spaced-wrapper"></div>
                <h2>Cat vaccinations</h2>
                <p>Your vet will recommend the correct vaccinations for your cat. These could include vaccinating against:</p>

                <ul class="icon-list-blue">
                    <li><p>Cat flu, a very infectious viral disease which can be fatal to cats</p></li>
                    <li><p>Feline Leukaemia, which can devastate the white blood cells and leave the immune system very vulnerable</p></li>
                    <li><p>Feline Infectious Enteritis, a highly infectious viral disease</p></li>
                    <li><p>Feline Chlamydia, which can often cause conjunctivitis and leave your cat vulnerable to other viruses</p></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="small-spaced-wrapper"></div>
                <h2>When should you vaccinate your cat?</h2>
                <p>A kitten can be vaccinated at around nine weeks. As with dogs, you should keep cats inside and away from other animals until they are fully vaccinated.</p>

                <h2>How much do vaccinations cost?</h2>
                <p>Contact your vet for vaccinations and booster prices.</p>

                <h2>Keep vaccination records</h2>
                <p class="medium-spaced-wrapper-bottom">Your vet will keep a record of all the vaccinations they have given your pets, but it’s a good idea to keep certificates in a safe place in case you need to show them to a kennel, for overseas travel and so on.</p>

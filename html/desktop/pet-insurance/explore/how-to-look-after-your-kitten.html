            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Food plays a vital role in your cat&rsquo;s health. A cat needs a diet that contains essential nutrients such as proteins, fibre and fats to ensure they stay healthy.
                </li>
                <li>A good quality, ready-made food will help to provide a well balanced diet.</li>
                <li>
                    Unlike dogs, cats are &lsquo;nibblers&rsquo; and prefer to graze throughout the day.
                </li>
                <li>Also, make sure that your cat always has access to a bowl of fresh water.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Well-being</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Keeping your cat well fed, properly wormed, regularly treated against parasites and fully vaccinated is important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grooming, stroking and playing with your cat will help build a bond and strong relationship with them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Playing and Hunting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kittens and cats need to play, miming hunting and predation.</li>
                <li>
                    Playing with a paper or cloth toy is a positive way for your cat to be active and express her natural instincts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It&rsquo;s also important you join in these games so it can learn to control its biting and scratching.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cats are very clever at keeping an illness well hidden, until it gets serious.</li>
                <li>
                    If you notice a change in behaviour or habits, ask your Vet for advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look out for signs such as loss of appetite, excessive drinking, vomiting, diarrhoea and scratching.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cat-proof your home and garden</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Before you get a cat or a kitten, scan your home for potential dangers to your new feline friend&rsquo;s health and safety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Always check ovens, washing machine drums or spin dryers. They are amusing hiding places &ndash; especially for small kittens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep all heavy and hazardous items including sewing needles, books and vases out of reach.
                </li>
                <li>Many plants are toxic to cats, so please be aware.</li>
            </ul>

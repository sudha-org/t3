        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Puppies, adults and senior dogs all have different nutritional needs &ndash; choosing the right food for the life stage of your dog is essential.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most foods come in a wet or dry form. Dry foods are more convenient and better for your dog&rsquo;s teeth.
            </li>
            <li>Always ensure plenty of fresh water is available.</li>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Regular daily exercise is essential for your dog&rsquo;s mental and physical wellbeing.
            </li>
            <li>
                It helps to prevent weight gain while keeping your dog agile and mobile.
            </li>
            <li>
                It improves and maintains your dog&rsquo;s cardiovascular fitness and muscle tone.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ask your Vet to advise you on an appropriate exercise regime depending on your dog&rsquo;s breed, size and age. This is particularly important if your pet has a medical problem.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Socialisation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Puppy socialisation should start as young as possible &ndash; the sooner the better.
            </li>
            <li>It helps &lsquo;shape&rsquo; their behaviour as they mature.</li>
            <li>
                Take the time to socialise with different people, other dogs and experience different environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Common problems relating to poor early socialisation include fear, anxiety and aggression.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Health risk - Lungworm</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lungworm is a dangerous parasite that can prove fatal to dogs but it can easily be prevented.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dogs get lungworm by ingesting snails or slugs. They can also get infected if they come in contact with contaminated water or toys.
            </li>
            <li>
                To minimise the risk, regularly use products to protect your pet against lungworm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Talk to your vet about treatment and prevention from lungworm.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dog-proofing your home and garden</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It&rsquo;s important to keep your dog&rsquo;s environment safe &ndash; at home and in the garden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep small items away from your dog &ndash; especially puppies. They love to explore and eat objects such as stones, bones and clothing but these can cause serious intestinal obstructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dogs need protection from household items too - they are toxic to them and can cause serious illness if swallowed. These include household cleaners, human chocolate, grapes, raisins and onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep your garden secure by checking fences for gaps and ensuring gates are always closed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dental health</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Keeping your dog&rsquo;s teeth clean is as important as it is your own.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clean their teeth once or twice a week to prevent the risk of infection and dental disease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some foods and treats can also help to keep your dog&rsquo;s teeth stay clean and healthy.
            </li>
        </ul>

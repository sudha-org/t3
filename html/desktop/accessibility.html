            <p>We feel it is very important that our website is accessible to all our users. Every page is designed with accessibility and usability in mind and taking into account recommendations in the Disability Discrimination Act and World Wide Web Consortium Guidelines. And for that reason, navigating around the site shouldn’t be a problem. </p>
            
            <p>We have also made sure the site is compatible with a number of screen readers, including ZoomText, NVDA, VoiceOver and Window Eyes. Checks have also been carried out on basic operating system screen magnifiers and speech recognition software.</p>

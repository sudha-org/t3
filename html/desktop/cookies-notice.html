            <h2>What are cookies and what other technologies will we use?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;</strong> - A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stays on your computer or mobile device when you visit our website. Cookies do not damage your device they are merely used to &lsquo;remember&rsquo; you when you visit again. Cookies alone cannot be used to identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
                A cookie will transport information about how you use our website to us. The cookie itself does not keep any of the data it collects.
            </p>
            <p>Apart from cookies we also use local storage and tags to help us enhance your browsing experience.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>&ldquo;Local storage&rdquo;</strong> - Like a cookie, local storage is stored locally on your machine; actually within your browser like cookies, history, saved pages, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like cookies it contains 'name/value' pairs (i.e. postcode / &quot;BR1 1BY&quot;, surname / &quot;Smith&quot;) and a web page can only access data stored locally within its domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike cookies the information collected by local storage is not sent to an internet server unless there is a specific reason for us to store the data collected (i.e. for analytics purposes).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>&ldquo;Tags&rdquo;</strong> - A tag is a small piece of code which is placed on our website and collects data. This code would only collect data on our website. A tag will not be stored on your browser, however, it may use a cookie which could be placed on your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lsquo;<strong>SessionCam</strong>&rsquo; - may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and text keyed into website forms &ndash; <em>no personal or payment data is collected</em>.
